       "'alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the\\nbank and of having nothing to do once or twice she had peeped into the\\nbook her sister was reading but it had no pictures or conversations in\\nit and what is the use of a book thought alice without pictures or\\nconversations\\nso she was considering in her own mind as well as she could for the\\nhot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid whether the pleasure\\nof making a daisychain would be worth the trouble of getting up and\\npicking the daisies when suddenly a white rabbit with pink eyes ran\\nclose by her\\nthere was nothing so very remarkable in that nor did alice think it so\\nvery much out of the way to hear the rabbit say to itself oh dear\\noh dear i shall be late when she thought it over afterwards it\\noccurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this but at the time\\nit all seemed quite natural but when the rabbit actually took a watch\\nout of its waistcoatpocket and looked at it and then hurried on\\nalice started to her feet for it flashed across her mind that she had\\nnever before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoatpocket or a watch\\nto take out of it and burning with curiosity she ran across the field\\nafter it and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large\\nrabbithole under the hedge\\nin another moment down went alice after it never once considering how\\nin the world she was to get out again\\nthe rabbithole went straight on like a tunnel for some way and then\\ndipped suddenly down so suddenly that alice had not a moment to think\\nabout stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep\\nwell\\neither the well was very deep or she fell very slowly for she had\\nplenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was\\ngoing to happen next first she tried to look down and make out what\\nshe was coming to but it was too dark to see anything then she\\nlooked at the sides of the well and noticed that they were filled with\\ncupboards and bookshelves here and there she saw maps and pictures\\nhung upon pegs she took down a jar from one of the shelves as\\nshe passed it was labelled orange marmalade but to her great\\ndisappointment it was empty she did not like to drop the jar for fear\\nof killing somebody so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as\\nshe fell past it\\nwell thought alice to herself after such a fall as this i shall\\nthink nothing of tumbling down stairs how brave theyll all think me at\\nhome why i wouldnt say anything about it even if i fell off the top\\nof the house which was very likely true\\ndown down down would the fall never come to an end i wonder how\\nmany miles ive fallen by this time she said aloud i must be getting\\nsomewhere near the centre of the earth let me see that would be four\\nthousand miles down i think for you see alice had learnt several\\nthings of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom and though this\\nwas not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge as there\\nwas no one to listen to her still it was good practice to say it over\\nyes thats about the right distancebut then i wonder what latitude\\nor longitude ive got to alice had no idea what latitude was or\\nlongitude either but thought they were nice grand words to say\\npresently she began again i wonder if i shall fall right through the\\nearth how funny itll seem to come out among the people that walk with\\ntheir heads downward the antipathies i think she was rather glad\\nthere was no one listening this time as it didnt sound at all the\\nright word but i shall have to ask them what the name of the country\\nis you know please maam is this new zealand or australia and\\nshe tried to curtsey as she spokefancy curtseying as youre falling\\nthrough the air do you think you could manage it and what an\\nignorant little girl shell think me for asking no itll never do to\\nask perhaps i shall see it written up somewhere\\ndown down down there was nothing else to do so alice soon began\\ntalking again dinahll miss me very much tonight i should think\\ndinah was the cat i hope theyll remember her saucer of milk at\\nteatime dinah my dear i wish you were down here with me there are no\\nmice in the air im afraid but you might catch a bat and thats very\\nlike a mouse you know but do cats eat bats i wonder and here alice\\nbegan to get rather sleepy and went on saying to herself in a dreamy\\nsort of way do cats eat bats do cats eat bats and sometimes do\\nbats eat cats for you see as she couldnt answer either question\\nit didnt much matter which way she put it she felt that she was dozing\\noff and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with\\ndinah and saying to her very earnestly now dinah tell me the truth\\ndid you ever eat a bat when suddenly thump thump down she came upon\\na heap of sticks and dry leaves and the fall was over\\nalice was not a bit hurt and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment\\nshe looked up but it was all dark overhead before her was another\\nlong passage and the white rabbit was still in sight hurrying down it\\nthere was not a moment to be lost away went alice like the wind and\\nwas just in time to hear it say as it turned a corner oh my ears\\nand whiskers how late its getting she was close behind it when she\\nturned the corner but the rabbit was no longer to be seen she found\\nherself in a long low hall which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging\\nfrom the roof\\nthere were doors all round the hall but they were all locked and when\\nalice had been all the way down one side and up the other trying every\\ndoor she walked sadly down the middle wondering how she was ever to\\nget out again\\nsuddenly she came upon a little threelegged table all made of solid\\nglass there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key and alices\\nfirst thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall\\nbut alas either the locks were too large or the key was too small\\nbut at any rate it would not open any of them however on the second\\ntime round she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before and\\nbehind it was a little door about fifteen inches high she tried the\\nlittle golden key in the lock and to her great delight it fitted\\nalice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage not\\nmuch larger than a rathole she knelt down and looked along the passage\\ninto the loveliest garden you ever saw how she longed to get out of\\nthat dark hall and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and\\nthose cool fountains but she could not even get her head through the\\ndoorway and even if my head would go through thought poor alice it\\nwould be of very little use without my shoulders oh how i wish i could\\nshut up like a telescope i think i could if i only knew how to begin\\nfor you see so many outoftheway things had happened lately\\nthat alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really\\nimpossible\\nthere seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door so she went\\nback to the table half hoping she might find another key on it or at\\nany rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes this\\ntime she found a little bottle on it which certainly was not here\\nbefore said alice and round the neck of the bottle was a paper\\nlabel with the words drink me beautifully printed on it in large\\nletters\\nit was all very well to say drink me but the wise little alice was\\nnot going to do that in a hurry no ill look first she said and\\nsee whether its marked poison or not for she had read several nice\\nlittle histories about children who had got burnt and eaten up by wild\\nbeasts and other unpleasant things all because they would not remember\\nthe simple rules their friends had taught them such as that a redhot\\npoker will burn you if you hold it too long and that if you cut your\\nfinger very deeply with a knife it usually bleeds and she had never\\nforgotten that if you drink much from a bottle marked poison it is\\nalmost certain to disagree with you sooner or later\\nhowever this bottle was not marked poison so alice ventured to taste\\nit and finding it very nice it had in fact a sort of mixed flavour\\nof cherrytart custard pineapple roast turkey toffee and hot\\nbuttered toast she very soon finished it off\\n                          \\n\\n                        \\n\\n                          \\nwhat a curious feeling said alice i must be shutting up like a\\ntelescope\\nand so it was indeed she was now only ten inches high and her face\\nbrightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going\\nthrough the little door into that lovely garden first however she\\nwaited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further\\nshe felt a little nervous about this for it might end you know said\\nalice to herself in my going out altogether like a candle i wonder\\nwhat i should be like then and she tried to fancy what the flame of a\\ncandle is like after the candle is blown out for she could not remember\\never having seen such a thing\\nafter a while finding that nothing more happened she decided on going\\ninto the garden at once but alas for poor alice when she got to the\\ndoor she found she had forgotten the little golden key and when she\\nwent back to the table for it she found she could not possibly reach\\nit she could see it quite plainly through the glass and she tried her\\nbest to climb up one of the legs of the table but it was too slippery\\nand when she had tired herself out with trying the poor little thing\\nsat down and cried\\ncome theres no use in crying like that said alice to herself\\nrather sharply i advise you to leave off this minute she generally\\ngave herself very good advice though she very seldom followed it\\nand sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into\\nher eyes and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having\\ncheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself\\nfor this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people\\nbut its no use now thought poor alice to pretend to be two people\\nwhy theres hardly enough of me left to make one respectable person\\nsoon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table\\nshe opened it and found in it a very small cake on which the words\\neat me were beautifully marked in currants well ill eat it said\\nalice and if it makes me grow larger i can reach the key and if it\\nmakes me grow smaller i can creep under the door so either way ill\\nget into the garden and i dont care which happens\\nshe ate a little bit and said anxiously to herself which way which\\nway holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was\\ngrowing and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same\\nsize to be sure this generally happens when one eats cake but alice\\nhad got so much into the way of expecting nothing but outoftheway\\nthings to happen that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on\\nin the common way\\nso she set to work and very soon finished off the cake\\n\\n                          \\n\\n                        \\n\\n                          \\ncuriouser and curiouser cried alice she was so much surprised that\\nfor the moment she quite forgot how to speak good english now im\\nopening out like the largest telescope that ever was goodbye feet\\nfor when she looked down at her feet they seemed to be almost out of\\nsight they were getting so far off oh my poor little feet i wonder\\nwho will put on your shoes and stockings for you now dears im sure\\ni shant be able i shall be a great deal too far off to trouble\\nmyself about you you must manage the best way you canbut i must be\\nkind to them thought alice or perhaps they wont walk the way i want\\nto go let me see ill give them a new pair of boots every christmas\\nand she went on planning to herself how she would manage it they must\\ngo by the carrier she thought and how funny itll seem sending\\npresents to ones own feet and how odd the directions will look\\n     alices right foot esq\\n       hearthrug\\n         near the fender\\n           with alices love\\noh dear what nonsense im talking\\njust then her head struck against the roof of the hall in fact she was\\nnow more than nine feet high and she at once took up the little golden\\nkey and hurried off to the garden door\\npoor alice it was as much as she could do lying down on one side to\\nlook through into the garden with one eye but to get through was more\\nhopeless than ever she sat down and began to cry again\\nyou ought to be ashamed of yourself said alice a great girl like\\nyou she might well say this to go on crying in this way stop this\\nmoment i tell you but she went on all the same shedding gallons of\\ntears until there was a large pool all round her about four inches\\ndeep and reaching half down the hall\\nafter a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance and\\nshe hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming it was the white\\nrabbit returning splendidly dressed with a pair of white kid gloves in\\none hand and a large fan in the other he came trotting along in a great\\nhurry muttering to himself as he came oh the duchess the duchess\\noh wont she be savage if ive kept her waiting alice felt so\\ndesperate that she was ready to ask help of any one so when the rabbit\\ncame near her she began in a low timid voice if you please sir\\nthe rabbit started violently dropped the white kid gloves and the fan\\nand skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go\\nalice took up the fan and gloves and as the hall was very hot she\\nkept fanning herself all the time she went on talking dear dear how\\nqueer everything is today and yesterday things went on just as usual\\ni wonder if ive been changed in the night let me think was i the\\nsame when i got up this morning i almost think i can remember feeling a\\nlittle different but if im not the same the next question is who\\nin the world am i ah thats the great puzzle and she began thinking\\nover all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself to\\nsee if she could have been changed for any of them\\nim sure im not ada she said for her hair goes in such long\\nringlets and mine doesnt go in ringlets at all and im sure i cant\\nbe mabel for i know all sorts of things and she oh she knows such a\\nvery little besides shes she and im i andoh dear how puzzling\\nit all is ill try if i know all the things i used to know let me\\nsee four times five is twelve and four times six is thirteen and\\nfour times seven isoh dear i shall never get to twenty at that rate\\nhowever the multiplication table doesnt signify lets try geography\\nlondon is the capital of paris and paris is the capital of rome and\\nromeno thats all wrong im certain i must have been changed for\\nmabel ill try and say how doth the little and she crossed her\\nhands on her lap as if she were saying lessons and began to repeat it\\nbut her voice sounded hoarse and strange and the words did not come the\\nsame as they used to do\\n     how doth the little crocodile\\n      improve his shining tail\\n     and pour the waters of the nile\\n      on every golden scale\\n\\n     how cheerfully he seems to grin\\n      how neatly spread his claws\\n     and welcome little fishes in\\n      with gently smiling jaws\\nim sure those are not the right words said poor alice and her eyes\\nfilled with tears again as she went on i must be mabel after all and\\ni shall have to go and live in that poky little house and have next to\\nno toys to play with and oh ever so many lessons to learn no ive\\nmade up my mind about it if im mabel ill stay down here itll be no\\nuse their putting their heads down and saying come up again dear i\\nshall only look up and say who am i then tell me that first and then\\nif i like being that person ill come up if not ill stay down here\\ntill im somebody elsebut oh dear cried alice with a sudden burst\\nof tears i do wish they would put their heads down i am so very tired\\nof being all alone here\\nas she said this she looked down at her hands and was surprised to see\\nthat she had put on one of the rabbits little white kid gloves while\\nshe was talking how can i have done that she thought i must\\nbe growing small again she got up and went to the table to measure\\nherself by it and found that as nearly as she could guess she was now\\nabout two feet high and was going on shrinking rapidly she soon found\\nout that the cause of this was the fan she was holding and she dropped\\nit hastily just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether\\nthat was a narrow escape said alice a good deal frightened at the\\nsudden change but very glad to find herself still in existence and\\nnow for the garden and she ran with all speed back to the little door\\nbut alas the little door was shut again and the little golden key was\\nlying on the glass table as before and things are worse than ever\\nthought the poor child for i never was so small as this before never\\nand i declare its too bad that it is\\nas she said these words her foot slipped and in another moment splash\\nshe was up to her chin in salt water her first idea was that she\\nhad somehow fallen into the sea and in that case i can go back by\\nrailway she said to herself alice had been to the seaside once in\\nher life and had come to the general conclusion that wherever you go\\nto on the english coast you find a number of bathing machines in the\\nsea some children digging in the sand with wooden spades then a row\\nof lodging houses and behind them a railway station however she soon\\nmade out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she\\nwas nine feet high\\ni wish i hadnt cried so much said alice as she swam about trying\\nto find her way out i shall be punished for it now i suppose by\\nbeing drowned in my own tears that will be a queer thing to be sure\\nhowever everything is queer today\\njust then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way\\noff and she swam nearer to make out what it was at first she thought\\nit must be a walrus or hippopotamus but then she remembered how small\\nshe was now and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had\\nslipped in like herself\\nwould it be of any use now thought alice to speak to this mouse\\neverything is so outoftheway down here that i should think very\\nlikely it can talk at any rate theres no harm in trying so she\\nbegan o mouse do you know the way out of this pool i am very tired\\nof swimming about here o mouse alice thought this must be the right\\nway of speaking to a mouse she had never done such a thing before but\\nshe remembered having seen in her brothers latin grammar a mouseof\\na mouseto a mousea mouseo mouse the mouse looked at her rather\\ninquisitively and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes\\nbut it said nothing\\nperhaps it doesnt understand english thought alice i daresay its\\na french mouse come over with william the conqueror for with all\\nher knowledge of history alice had no very clear notion how long ago\\nanything had happened so she began again ou est ma chatte which\\nwas the first sentence in her french lessonbook the mouse gave a\\nsudden leap out of the water and seemed to quiver all over with fright\\noh i beg your pardon cried alice hastily afraid that she had hurt\\nthe poor animals feelings i quite forgot you didnt like cats\\nnot like cats cried the mouse in a shrill passionate voice would\\nyou like cats if you were me\\nwell perhaps not said alice in a soothing tone dont be angry\\nabout it and yet i wish i could show you our cat dinah i think youd\\ntake a fancy to cats if you could only see her she is such a dear quiet\\nthing alice went on half to herself as she swam lazily about in the\\npool and she sits purring so nicely by the fire licking her paws and\\nwashing her faceand she is such a nice soft thing to nurseand shes\\nsuch a capital one for catching miceoh i beg your pardon cried\\nalice again for this time the mouse was bristling all over and she\\nfelt certain it must be really offended we wont talk about her any\\nmore if youd rather not\\nwe indeed cried the mouse who was trembling down to the end of his\\ntail as if i would talk on such a subject our family always hated\\ncats nasty low vulgar things dont let me hear the name again\\ni wont indeed said alice in a great hurry to change the subject of\\nconversation are youare you fondofof dogs the mouse did not\\nanswer so alice went on eagerly there is such a nice little dog near\\nour house i should like to show you a little brighteyed terrier you\\nknow with oh such long curly brown hair and itll fetch things when\\nyou throw them and itll sit up and beg for its dinner and all sorts\\nof thingsi cant remember half of themand it belongs to a farmer\\nyou know and he says its so useful its worth a hundred pounds he\\nsays it kills all the rats andoh dear cried alice in a sorrowful\\ntone im afraid ive offended it again for the mouse was swimming\\naway from her as hard as it could go and making quite a commotion in\\nthe pool as it went\\nso she called softly after it mouse dear do come back again and we\\nwont talk about cats or dogs either if you dont like them when the\\nmouse heard this it turned round and swam slowly back to her its\\nface was quite pale with passion alice thought and it said in a low\\ntrembling voice let us get to the shore and then ill tell you my\\nhistory and youll understand why it is i hate cats and dogs\\nit was high time to go for the pool was getting quite crowded with the\\nbirds and animals that had fallen into it there were a duck and a dodo\\na lory and an eaglet and several other curious creatures alice led the\\nway and the whole party swam to the shore\\nthey were indeed a queerlooking party that assembled on the bankthe\\nbirds with draggled feathers the animals with their fur clinging close\\nto them and all dripping wet cross and uncomfortable\\nthe first question of course was how to get dry again they had a\\nconsultation about this and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural\\nto alice to find herself talking familiarly with them as if she had\\nknown them all her life indeed she had quite a long argument with the\\nlory who at last turned sulky and would only say i am older than\\nyou and must know better and this alice would not allow without\\nknowing how old it was and as the lory positively refused to tell its\\nage there was no more to be said\\nat last the mouse who seemed to be a person of authority among them\\ncalled out sit down all of you and listen to me ill soon make you\\ndry enough they all sat down at once in a large ring with the mouse\\nin the middle alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it for she felt\\nsure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon\\nahem said the mouse with an important air are you all ready this\\nis the driest thing i know silence all round if you please william\\nthe conqueror whose cause was favoured by the pope was soon submitted\\nto by the english who wanted leaders and had been of late much\\naccustomed to usurpation and conquest edwin and morcar the earls of\\nmercia and northumbria\\nugh said the lory with a shiver\\ni beg your pardon said the mouse frowning but very politely did\\nyou speak\\nnot i said the lory hastily\\ni thought you did said the mouse i proceed edwin and morcar\\nthe earls of mercia and northumbria declared for him and even stigand\\nthe patriotic archbishop of canterbury found it advisable\\nfound what said the duck\\nfound it the mouse replied rather crossly of course you know what\\nit means\\ni know what it means well enough when i find a thing said the\\nduck its generally a frog or a worm the question is what did the\\narchbishop find\\nthe mouse did not notice this question but hurriedly went on found\\nit advisable to go with edgar atheling to meet william and offer him the\\ncrown williams conduct at first was moderate but the insolence of his\\nnormans how are you getting on now my dear it continued turning\\nto alice as it spoke\\nas wet as ever said alice in a melancholy tone it doesnt seem to\\ndry me at all\\nin that case said the dodo solemnly rising to its feet i move\\nthat the meeting adjourn for the immediate adoption of more energetic\\nremedies\\nspeak english said the eaglet i dont know the meaning of half\\nthose long words and whats more i dont believe you do either and\\nthe eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile some of the other birds\\ntittered audibly\\nwhat i was going to say said the dodo in an offended tone was that\\nthe best thing to get us dry would be a caucusrace\\nwhat is a caucusrace said alice not that she wanted much to know\\nbut the dodo had paused as if it thought that somebody ought to speak\\nand no one else seemed inclined to say anything\\nwhy said the dodo the best way to explain it is to do it and as\\nyou might like to try the thing yourself some winter day i will tell\\nyou how the dodo managed it\\nfirst it marked out a racecourse in a sort of circle the exact\\nshape doesnt matter it said and then all the party were placed\\nalong the course here and there there was no one two three and\\naway but they began running when they liked and left off when they\\nliked so that it was not easy to know when the race was over however\\nwhen they had been running half an hour or so and were quite dry again\\nthe dodo suddenly called out the race is over and they all crowded\\nround it panting and asking but who has won\\nthis question the dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought\\nand it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead\\nthe position in which you usually see shakespeare in the pictures\\nof him while the rest waited in silence at last the dodo said\\neverybody has won and all must have prizes\\nbut who is to give the prizes quite a chorus of voices asked\\nwhy she of course said the dodo pointing to alice with one finger\\nand the whole party at once crowded round her calling out in a confused\\nway prizes prizes\\nalice had no idea what to do and in despair she put her hand in her\\npocket and pulled out a box of comfits luckily the salt water had\\nnot got into it and handed them round as prizes there was exactly one\\napiece all round\\nbut she must have a prize herself you know said the mouse\\nof course the dodo replied very gravely what else have you got in\\nyour pocket he went on turning to alice\\nonly a thimble said alice sadly\\nhand it over here said the dodo\\nthen they all crowded round her once more while the dodo solemnly\\npresented the thimble saying we beg your acceptance of this elegant\\nthimble and when it had finished this short speech they all cheered\\nalice thought the whole thing very absurd but they all looked so grave\\nthat she did not dare to laugh and as she could not think of anything\\nto say she simply bowed and took the thimble looking as solemn as she\\ncould\\nthe next thing was to eat the comfits this caused some noise and\\nconfusion as the large birds complained that they could not taste\\ntheirs and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back\\nhowever it was over at last and they sat down again in a ring and\\nbegged the mouse to tell them something more\\nyou promised to tell me your history you know said alice and why\\nit is you hatec and d she added in a whisper half afraid that it\\nwould be offended again\\nmine is a long and a sad tale said the mouse turning to alice and\\nsighing\\nit is a long tail certainly said alice looking down with wonder at\\nthe mouses tail but why do you call it sad and she kept on puzzling\\nabout it while the mouse was speaking so that her idea of the tale was\\nsomething like this\\n         fury said to a\\n         mouse that he\\n        met in the\\n       house\\n

herself useful and looking\\nanxiously about her oh do let me help to undo it\\ni shall do nothing of the sort said the mouse getting up and walking\\naway you insult me by talking such nonsense\\ni didnt mean it pleaded poor alice but youre so easily offended\\nyou know\\nthe mouse only growled in reply\\nplease come back and finish your story alice called after it and the\\nothers all joined in chorus yes please do but the mouse only shook\\nits head impatiently and walked a little quicker\\nwhat a pity it wouldnt stay sighed the lory as soon as it was quite\\nout of sight and an old crab took the opportunity of saying to her\\ndaughter ah my dear let this be a lesson to you never to lose\\nyour temper hold your tongue ma said the young crab a little\\nsnappishly youre enough to try the patience of an oyster\\ni wish i had our dinah here i know i do said alice aloud addressing\\nnobody in particular shed soon fetch it back\\nand who is dinah if i might venture to ask the question said the\\nlory\\nalice replied eagerly for she was always ready to talk about her pet\\ndinahs our cat and shes such a capital one for catching mice you\\ncant think and oh i wish you could see her after the birds why\\nshell eat a little bird as soon as look at it\\nthis speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party some of the\\nbirds hurried off at once one old magpie began wrapping itself up very\\ncarefully remarking i really must be getting home the nightair\\ndoesnt suit my throat and a canary called out in a trembling voice to\\nits children come away my dears its high time you were all in bed\\non various pretexts they all moved off and alice was soon left alone\\ni wish i hadnt mentioned dinah she said to herself in a melancholy\\ntone nobody seems to like her down here and im sure shes the best\\ncat in the world oh my dear dinah i wonder if i shall ever see you\\nany more and here poor alice began to cry again for she felt very\\nlonely and lowspirited in a little while however she again heard\\na little pattering of footsteps in the distance and she looked up\\neagerly half hoping that the mouse had changed his mind and was coming\\nback to finish his story\\nit was the white rabbit trotting slowly back again and looking\\nanxiously about as it went as if it had lost something and she heard\\nit muttering to itself the duchess the duchess oh my dear paws oh\\nmy fur and whiskers shell get me executed as sure as ferrets are\\nferrets where can i have dropped them i wonder alice guessed in a\\nmoment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves\\nand she very goodnaturedly began hunting about for them but they were\\nnowhere to be seeneverything seemed to have changed since her swim in\\nthe pool and the great hall with the glass table and the little door\\nhad vanished completely\\nvery soon the rabbit noticed alice as she went hunting about and\\ncalled out to her in an angry tone why mary ann what are you doing\\nout here run home this moment and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan\\nquick now and alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once\\nin the direction it pointed to without trying to explain the mistake it\\nhad made\\nhe took me for his housemaid she said to herself as she ran how\\nsurprised hell be when he finds out who i am but id better take him\\nhis fan and glovesthat is if i can find them as she said this she\\ncame upon a neat little house on the door of which was a bright brass\\nplate with the name w rabbit engraved upon it she went in without\\nknocking and hurried upstairs in great fear lest she should meet the\\nreal mary ann and be turned out of the house before she had found the\\nfan and gloves\\nhow queer it seems alice said to herself to be going messages for\\na rabbit i suppose dinahll be sending me on messages next and she\\nbegan fancying the sort of thing that would happen miss alice come\\nhere directly and get ready for your walk coming in a minute\\nnurse but ive got to see that the mouse doesnt get out only i dont\\nthink alice went on that theyd let dinah stop in the house if it\\nbegan ordering people about like that\\nby this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table\\nin the window and on it as she had hoped a fan and two or three pairs\\nof tiny white kid gloves she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves\\nand was just going to leave the room when her eye fell upon a little\\nbottle that stood near the lookingglass there was no label this time\\nwith the words drink me but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it\\nto her lips i know something interesting is sure to happen she said\\nto herself whenever i eat or drink anything so ill just see what\\nthis bottle does i do hope itll make me grow large again for really\\nim quite tired of being such a tiny little thing\\nit did so indeed and much sooner than she had expected before she had\\ndrunk half the bottle she found her head pressing against the ceiling\\nand had to stoop to save her neck from being broken she hastily put\\ndown the bottle saying to herself thats quite enoughi hope i shant\\ngrow any moreas it is i cant get out at the doori do wish i hadnt\\ndrunk quite so much\\nalas it was too late to wish that she went on growing and growing\\nand very soon had to kneel down on the floor in another minute there\\nwas not even room for this and she tried the effect of lying down with\\none elbow against the door and the other arm curled round her head\\nstill she went on growing and as a last resource she put one arm out\\nof the window and one foot up the chimney and said to herself now i\\ncan do no more whatever happens what will become of me\\nluckily for alice the little magic bottle had now had its full effect\\nand she grew no larger still it was very uncomfortable and as there\\nseemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room\\nagain no wonder she felt unhappy\\nit was much pleasanter at home thought poor alice when one wasnt\\nalways growing larger and smaller and being ordered about by mice and\\nrabbits i almost wish i hadnt gone down that rabbitholeand yetand\\nyetits rather curious you know this sort of life i do wonder what\\ncan have happened to me when i used to read fairytales i fancied that\\nkind of thing never happened and now here i am in the middle of one\\nthere ought to be a book written about me that there ought and when i\\ngrow up ill write onebut im grown up now she added in a sorrowful\\ntone at least theres no room to grow up any more here\\nbut then thought alice shall i never get any older than i am\\nnow thatll be a comfort one waynever to be an old womanbut\\nthenalways to have lessons to learn oh i shouldnt like that\\noh you foolish alice she answered herself how can you learn\\nlessons in here why theres hardly room for you and no room at all\\nfor any lessonbooks\\nand so she went on taking first one side and then the other and making\\nquite a conversation of it altogether but after a few minutes she heard\\na voice outside and stopped to listen\\nmary ann mary ann said the voice fetch me my gloves this moment\\nthen came a little pattering of feet on the stairs alice knew it was\\nthe rabbit coming to look for her and she trembled till she shook the\\nhouse quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large\\nas the rabbit and had no reason to be afraid of it\\npresently the rabbit came up to the door and tried to open it but as\\nthe door opened inwards and alices elbow was pressed hard against it\\nthat attempt proved a failure alice heard it say to itself then ill\\ngo round and get in at the window\\nthat you wont thought alice and after waiting till she fancied\\nshe heard the rabbit just under the window she suddenly spread out her\\nhand and made a snatch in the air she did not get hold of anything\\nbut she heard a little shriek and a fall and a crash of broken glass\\nfrom which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a\\ncucumberframe or something of the sort\\nnext came an angry voicethe rabbitspat pat where are you and\\nthen a voice she had never heard before sure then im here digging\\nfor apples yer honour\\ndigging for apples indeed said the rabbit angrily here come and\\nhelp me out of this sounds of more broken glass\\nnow tell me pat whats that in the window\\nsure its an arm yer honour he pronounced it arrum\\nan arm you goose who ever saw one that size why it fills the whole\\nwindow\\nsure it does yer honour but its an arm for all that\\nwell its got no business there at any rate go and take it away\\nthere was a long silence after this and alice could only hear whispers\\nnow and then such as sure i dont like it yer honour at all at\\nall do as i tell you you coward and at last she spread out her\\nhand again and made another snatch in the air this time there were\\ntwo little shrieks and more sounds of broken glass what a number of\\ncucumberframes there must be thought alice i wonder what theyll do\\nnext as for pulling me out of the window i only wish they could im\\nsure i dont want to stay in here any longer\\nshe waited for some time without hearing anything more at last came a\\nrumbling of little cartwheels and the sound of a good many voices\\nall talking together she made out the words wheres the other\\nladderwhy i hadnt to bring but one bills got the otherbill\\nfetch it here ladhere put em up at this cornerno tie em\\ntogether firstthey dont reach half high enough yetoh theyll\\ndo well enough dont be particularhere bill catch hold of this\\nropewill the roof bearmind that loose slateoh its coming\\ndown heads below a loud crashnow who did thatit was bill i\\nfancywhos to go down the chimneynay i shant you do itthat i\\nwont thenbills to go downhere bill the master says youre to\\ngo down the chimney\\noh so bills got to come down the chimney has he said alice to\\nherself shy they seem to put everything upon bill i wouldnt be in\\nbills place for a good deal this fireplace is narrow to be sure but\\ni think i can kick a little\\nshe drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could and waited\\ntill she heard a little animal she couldnt guess of what sort it was\\nscratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her then\\nsaying to herself this is bill she gave one sharp kick and waited to\\nsee what would happen next\\nthe first thing she heard was a general chorus of there goes bill\\nthen the rabbits voice alongcatch him you by the hedge then\\nsilence and then another confusion of voiceshold up his headbrandy\\nnowdont choke himhow was it old fellow what happened to you tell\\nus all about it\\nlast came a little feeble squeaking voice thats bill thought\\nalice well i hardly knowno more thank ye im better nowbut im\\na deal too flustered to tell youall i know is something comes at me\\nlike a jackinthebox and up i goes like a skyrocket\\nso you did old fellow said the others\\nwe must burn the house down said the rabbits voice and alice called\\nout as loud as she could if you do ill set dinah at you\\nthere was a dead silence instantly and alice thought to herself i\\nwonder what they will do next if they had any sense theyd take the\\nroof off after a minute or two they began moving about again and\\nalice heard the rabbit say a barrowful will do to begin with\\na barrowful of what thought alice but she had not long to doubt\\nfor the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the\\nwindow and some of them hit her in the face ill put a stop to this\\nshe said to herself and shouted out youd better not do that again\\nwhich produced another dead silence\\nalice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into\\nlittle cakes as they lay on the floor and a bright idea came into her\\nhead if i eat one of these cakes she thought its sure to make\\nsome change in my size and as it cant possibly make me larger it must\\nmake me smaller i suppose\\nso she swallowed one of the cakes and was delighted to find that she\\nbegan shrinking directly as soon as she was small enough to get through\\nthe door she ran out of the house and found quite a crowd of little\\nanimals and birds waiting outside the poor little lizard bill was\\nin the middle being held up by two guineapigs who were giving it\\nsomething out of a bottle they all made a rush at alice the moment she\\nappeared but she ran off as hard as she could and soon found herself\\nsafe in a thick wood\\nthe first thing ive got to do said alice to herself as she wandered\\nabout in the wood is to grow to my right size again and the second\\nthing is to find my way into that lovely garden i think that will be\\nthe best plan\\nit sounded an excellent plan no doubt and very neatly and simply\\narranged the only difficulty was that she had not the smallest idea\\nhow to set about it and while she was peering about anxiously among\\nthe trees a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a\\ngreat hurry\\nan enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes and\\nfeebly stretching out one paw trying to touch her poor little thing\\nsaid alice in a coaxing tone and she tried hard to whistle to it but\\nshe was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be\\nhungry in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of\\nall her coaxing\\nhardly knowing what she did she picked up a little bit of stick and\\nheld it out to the puppy whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off\\nall its feet at once with a yelp of delight and rushed at the stick\\nand made believe to worry it then alice dodged behind a great thistle\\nto keep herself from being run over and the moment she appeared on the\\nother side the puppy made another rush at the stick and tumbled head\\nover heels in its hurry to get hold of it then alice thinking it was\\nvery like having a game of play with a carthorse and expecting every\\nmoment to be trampled under its feet ran round the thistle again then\\nthe puppy began a series of short charges at the stick running a very\\nlittle way forwards each time and a long way back and barking hoarsely\\nall the while till at last it sat down a good way off panting with\\nits tongue hanging out of its mouth and its great eyes half shut\\nthis seemed to alice a good opportunity for making her escape so she\\nset off at once and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath and\\ntill the puppys bark sounded quite faint in the distance\\nand yet what a dear little puppy it was said alice as she leant\\nagainst a buttercup to rest herself and fanned herself with one of the\\nleaves i should have liked teaching it tricks very much ifif id\\nonly been the right size to do it oh dear id nearly forgotten that\\nive got to grow up again let me seehow is it to be managed i\\nsuppose i ought to eat or drink something or other but the great\\nquestion is what\\nthe great question certainly was what alice looked all round her at\\nthe flowers and the blades of grass but she did not see anything that\\nlooked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances\\nthere was a large mushroom growing near her about the same height as\\nherself and when she had looked under it and on both sides of it and\\nbehind it it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what\\nwas on the top of it\\nshe stretched herself up on tiptoe and peeped over the edge of the\\nmushroom and her eyes immediately met those of a large caterpillar\\nthat was sitting on the top with its arms folded quietly smoking a long\\nhookah and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else\\nthe caterpillar and alice looked at each other for some time in silence\\nat last the caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and addressed\\nher in a languid sleepy voice\\nwho are you said the caterpillar\\nthis was not an encouraging opening for a conversation alice replied\\nrather shyly ii hardly know sir just at presentat least i know\\nwho i was when i got up this morning but i think i must have been\\nchanged several times since then\\nwhat do you mean by that said the caterpillar sternly explain\\nyourself\\ni cant explain myself im afraid sir said alice because im not\\nmyself you see\\ni dont see said the caterpillar\\nim afraid i cant put it more clearly alice replied very politely\\nfor i cant understand it myself to begin with and being so many\\ndifferent sizes in a day is very confusing\\nit isnt said the caterpillar\\nwell perhaps you havent found it so yet said alice but when you\\nhave to turn into a chrysalisyou will some day you knowand then\\nafter that into a butterfly i should think youll feel it a little\\nqueer wont you\\nnot a bit said the caterpillar\\nwell perhaps your feelings may be different said alice all i know\\nis it would feel very queer to me\\nyou said the caterpillar contemptuously who are you\\nwhich brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation\\nalice felt a little irritated at the caterpillars making such very\\nshort remarks and she drew herself up and said very gravely i think\\nyou ought to tell me who you are first\\nwhy said the caterpillar\\nhere was another puzzling question and as alice could not think of any\\ngood reason and as the caterpillar seemed to be in a very unpleasant\\nstate of mind she turned away\\ncome back the caterpillar called after her ive something important\\nto say\\nthis sounded promising certainly alice turned and came back again\\nkeep your temper said the caterpillar\\nis that all said alice swallowing down her anger as well as she\\ncould\\nno said the caterpillar\\nalice thought she might as well wait as she had nothing else to do and\\nperhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing for some\\nminutes it puffed away without speaking but at last it unfolded its\\narms took the hookah out of its mouth again and said so you think\\nyoure changed do you\\nim afraid i am sir said alice i cant remember things as i\\nusedand i dont keep the same size for ten minutes together\\ncant remember what things said the caterpillar\\nwell ive tried to say how doth the little busy bee but it all came\\ndifferent alice replied in a very melancholy voice\\nrepeat you are old father william said the caterpillar\\nalice folded her hands and began\\n   you are old father william the young man said\\n    and your hair has become very white\\n   and yet you incessantly stand on your head\\n    do you think at your age it is right\\n   in my youth father william replied to his son\\n    i feared it might injure the brain\\n   but now that im perfectly sure i have none\\n    why i do it again and again\\n   you are old said the youth as i mentioned before\\n    and have grown most uncommonly fat\\n   yet you turned a backsomersault in at the door\\n    pray what is the reason of that\\n   in my youth said the sage as he shook his grey locks\\n    i kept all my limbs very supple\\n   by the use of this ointmentone shilling the box\\n    allow me to sell you a couple\\n   you are old said the youth and your jaws are too weak\\n    for anything tougher than suet\\n   yet you finished the goose with the bones and the beak\\n    pray how did you manage to do it\\n   in my youth said his father i took to the law\\n    and argued each case with my wife\\n   and the muscular strength which it gave to my jaw\\n    has lasted the rest of my life\\n   you are old said the youth one would hardly suppose\\n    that your eye was as steady as ever\\n   yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose\\n    what made you so awfully clever\\n   i have answered three questions and that is enough\\n    said his father dont give yourself airs\\n   do you think i can listen all day to such stuff\\n    be off or ill kick you down stairs\\nthat is not said right said the caterpillar\\nnot quite right im afraid said alice timidly some of the words\\nhave got altered\\nit is wrong from beginning to end said the caterpillar decidedly and\\nthere was silence for some minutes\\nthe caterpillar was the first to speak\\nwhat size do you want to be it asked\\noh im not particular as to size alice hastily replied only one\\ndoesnt like changing so often you know\\ni dont know said the caterpillar\\nalice said nothing she had never been so much contradicted in her life\\nbefore and she felt that she was losing her temper\\nare you content now said the caterpillar\\nwell i should like to be a little larger sir if you wouldnt mind\\nsaid alice three inches is such a wretched height to be\\nit is a very good height indeed said the caterpillar angrily rearing\\nitself upright as it spoke it was exactly three inches high\\nbut im not used to it pleaded poor alice in a piteous tone and\\nshe thought of herself i wish the creatures wouldnt be so easily\\noffended\\nyoull get used to it in time said the caterpillar and it put the\\nhookah into its mouth and began smoking again\\nthis time alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again in\\na minute or two the caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth\\nand yawned once or twice and shook itself then it got down off the\\nmushroom and crawled away in the grass merely remarking as it went\\none side will make you grow taller and the other side will make you\\ngrow shorter\\none side of what the other side of what thought alice to herself\\nof the mushroom said the caterpillar just as if she had asked it\\naloud and in another moment it was out of sight\\nalice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute trying\\nto make out which were the two sides of it and as it was perfectly\\nround she found this a very difficult question however at last she\\nstretched her arms round it as far as they would go and broke off a bit\\nof the edge with each hand\\nand now which is which she said to herself and nibbled a little of\\nthe righthand bit to try the effect the next moment she felt a violent\\nblow underneath her chin it had struck her foot\\nshe was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change but she felt\\nthat there was no time to be lost as she was shrinking rapidly so she\\nset to work at once to eat some of the other bit her chin was pressed\\nso closely against her foot that there was hardly room to open her\\nmouth but she did it at last and managed to swallow a morsel of the\\nlefthand bit\\n                          \\n\\n                        \\n\\n                          \\ncome my heads free at last said alice in a tone of delight which\\nchanged into alarm in another moment when she found that her shoulders\\nwere nowhere to be found all she could see when she looked down was\\nan immense length of neck which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a\\nsea of green leaves that lay far below her\\nwhat can all that green stuff be said alice and where have my\\nshoulders got to and oh my poor hands how is it i cant see you\\nshe was moving them about as she spoke but no result seemed to follow\\nexcept a little shaking among the distant green leaves\\nas there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head she\\ntried to get her head down to them and was delighted to find that her\\nneck would bend about easily in any direction like a serpent she had\\njust succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag and was going\\nto dive in among the leaves which she found to be nothing but the tops\\nof the trees under which she had been wandering when a sharp hiss made\\nher draw back in a hurry a large pigeon had flown into her face and\\nwas beating her violently with its wings\\nserpent screamed the pigeon\\nim not a serpent said alice indignantly let me alone\\nserpent i say again repeated the pigeon but in a more subdued tone\\nand added with a kind of sob ive tried every way and nothing seems\\nto suit them\\ni havent the least idea what youre talking about said alice\\nive tried the roots of trees and ive tried banks and ive tried\\nhedges the pigeon went on without attending to her but those\\nserpents theres no pleasing them\\nalice was more and more puzzled but she thought there was no use in\\nsaying anything more till the pigeon had finished\\nas if it wasnt trouble enough hatching the eggs said the pigeon\\nbut i must be on the lookout for serpents night and day why i\\nhavent had a wink of sleep these three weeks\\nim very sorry youve been annoyed said alice who was beginning to\\nsee its meaning\\nand just as id taken the highest tree in the wood continued the\\npigeon raising its voice to a shriek and just as i was thinking i\\nshould be free of them at last they must needs come wriggling down from\\nthe sky ugh serpent\\nbut im not a serpent i tell you said alice im aim a\\nwell what are you said the pigeon i can see youre trying to\\ninvent something\\niim a little girl said alice rather doubtfully as she remembered\\nthe number of changes she had gone through that day\\na likely story indeed said the pigeon in a tone of the deepest\\ncontempt ive seen a good many little girls in my time but never one\\nwith such a neck as that no no youre a serpent and theres no use\\ndenying it i suppose youll be telling me next that you never tasted an\\negg\\ni have tasted eggs certainly said alice who was a very truthful\\nchild but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do you\\nknow\\ni dont believe it said the pigeon but if they do why then theyre\\na kind of serpent thats all i can say\\nthis was such a new idea to alice that she was quite silent for a\\nminute or two which gave the pigeon the opportunity of adding youre\\nlooking for eggs i know that well enough and what does it matter to me\\nwhether youre a little girl or a serpent\\nit matters a good deal to me said alice hastily but im not looking\\nfor eggs as it happens and if i was i shouldnt want yours i dont\\nlike them raw\\nwell be off then said the pigeon in a sulky tone as it settled\\ndown again into its nest alice crouched down among the trees as well as\\nshe could for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches and\\nevery now and then she had to stop and untwist it after a while she\\nremembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands and\\nshe set to work very carefully nibbling first at one and then at the\\nother and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter until she had\\nsucceeded in bringing herself down to her usual height\\nit was so long since she had been anything near the right size that it\\nfelt quite strange at first but she got used to it in a few minutes\\nand began talking to herself as usual come theres half my plan done\\nnow how puzzling all these changes are im never sure what im going\\nto be from one minute to another however ive got back to my right\\nsize the next thing is to get into that beautiful gardenhow is that\\nto be done i wonder as she said this she came suddenly upon an open\\nplace with a little house in it about four feet high whoever lives\\nthere thought alice itll never do to come upon them this size why\\ni should frighten them out of their wits so she began nibbling at the\\nrighthand bit again and did not venture to go near the house till she\\nhad brought herself down to nine inches high\\nfor a minute or two she stood looking at the house and wondering what\\nto do next when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the\\nwoodshe considered him to be a footman because he was in livery\\notherwise judging by his face only she would have called him a\\nfishand rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles it was opened\\nby another footman in livery with a round face and large eyes like a\\nfrog and both footmen alice noticed had powdered hair that curled all\\nover their heads she felt very curious to know what it was all about\\nand crept a little way out of the wood to listen\\nthe fishfootman began by producing from under his arm a great letter\\nnearly as large as himself and this he handed over to the other\\nsaying in a solemn tone for the duchess an invitation from the queen\\nto play croquet the frogfootman repeated in the same solemn tone\\nonly changing the order of the words a little from the queen an\\ninvitation for the duchess to play croquet\\nthen they both bowed low and their curls got entangled together\\nalice laughed so much at this that she had to run back into the\\nwood for fear of their hearing her and when she next peeped out the\\nfishfootman was gone and the other was sitting on the ground near the\\ndoor staring stupidly up into the sky\\nalice went timidly up to the door and knocked\\ntheres no sort of use in knocking said the footman and that for\\ntwo reasons first because im on the same side of the door as you\\nare secondly because theyre making such a noise inside no one could\\npossibly hear you and certainly there was a most extraordinary noise\\ngoing on withina constant howling and sneezing and every now and then\\na great crash as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces\\nplease then said alice how am i to get in\\nthere might be some sense in your knocking the footman went on\\nwithout attending to her if we had the door between us for instance\\nif you were inside you might knock and i could let you out you know\\nhe was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking and this\\nalice thought decidedly uncivil but perhaps he cant help it she\\nsaid to herself his eyes are so very nearly at the top of his head\\nbut at any rate he might answer questionshow am i to get in she\\nrepeated aloud\\ni shall sit here the footman remarked till tomorrow\\nat this moment the door of the house opened and a large plate came\\nskimming out straight at the footmans head it just grazed his nose\\nand broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him\\nor next day maybe the footman continued in the same tone exactly\\nas if nothing had happened\\nhow am i to get in asked alice again in a louder tone\\nare you to get in at all said the footman thats the first\\nquestion you know\\nit was no doubt only alice did not like to be told so its really\\ndreadful she muttered to herself the way all the creatures argue\\nits enough to drive one crazy\\n\\nthe footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his\\nremark with variations i shall sit here he said on and off for\\ndays and days\\nbut what am i to do said alice\\nanything you like said the footman and began whistling\\noh theres no use in talking to him said alice desperately hes\\nperfectly idiotic and she opened the door and went in\\nthe door led right into a large kitchen which was full of smoke from\\none end to the other the duchess was sitting on a threelegged stool in\\nthe middle nursing a baby the cook was leaning over the fire stirring\\na large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup\\ntheres certainly too much pepper in that soup alice said to herself\\nas well as she could for sneezing\\nthere was certainly too much of it in the air even the duchess\\nsneezed occasionally and as for the baby it was sneezing and howling\\nalternately without a moments pause the only things in the kitchen\\nthat did not sneeze were the cook and a large cat which was sitting on\\nthe hearth and grinning from ear to ear\\nplease would you tell me said alice a little timidly for she was\\nnot quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first why\\nyour cat grins like that\\nits a cheshire cat said the duchess and thats why pig\\nshe said the last word with such sudden violence that alice quite\\njumped but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby\\nand not to her so she took courage and went on again\\ni didnt know that cheshire cats always grinned in fact i didnt know\\nthat cats could grin\\nthey all can said the duchess and most of em do\\ni dont know of any that do alice said very politely feeling quite\\npleased to have got into a conversation\\nyou dont know much said the duchess and thats a fact\\nalice did not at all like the tone of this remark and thought it would\\nbe as well to introduce some other subject of conversation while she\\nwas trying to fix on one the cook took the cauldron of soup off the\\nfire and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at\\nthe duchess and the babythe fireirons came first then followed a\\nshower of saucepans plates and dishes the duchess took no notice of\\nthem even when they hit her and the baby was howling so much already\\nthat it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not\\noh please mind what youre doing cried alice jumping up and down in\\nan agony of terror oh there goes his precious nose as an unusually\\nlarge saucepan flew close by it and very nearly carried it off\\nif everybody minded their own business the duchess said in a hoarse\\ngrowl the world would go round a deal faster than it does\\nwhich would not be an advantage said alice who felt very glad to get\\nan opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge just think of\\nwhat work it would make with the day and night you see the earth takes\\ntwentyfour hours to turn round on its axis\\n\\ntalking of axes said the duchess chop off her head\\n\\nalice glanced rather anxiously at the cook to see if she meant to take\\nthe hint but the cook was busily stirring the soup and seemed not to\\nbe listening so she went on again twentyfour hours i think or is\\nit twelve i\\noh dont bother me said the duchess i never could abide figures\\nand with that she began nursing her child again singing a sort of\\nlullaby to it as she did so and giving it a violent shake at the end of\\nevery line\\n   speak roughly to your little boy\\n    and beat him when he sneezes\\n   he only does it to annoy\\n    because he knows it teases\\n         chorus\\n in which the cook and the baby joined\\n       wow wow wow\\nwhile the duchess sang the second verse of the song she kept tossing\\nthe baby violently up and down and the poor little thing howled so\\nthat alice could hardly hear the words\\n   i speak severely to my boy\\n    i beat him when he sneezes\\n   for he can thoroughly enjoy\\n    the pepper when he pleases\\n         chorus\\n       wow wow wow\\nhere you may nurse it a bit if you like the duchess said to alice\\nflinging the baby at her as she spoke i must go and get ready to play\\ncroquet with the queen and she hurried out of the room the cook threw\\na fryingpan after her as she went out but it just missed her\\nalice caught the baby with some difficulty as it was a queershaped\\nlittle creature and held out its arms and legs in all directions just\\nlike a starfish thought alice the poor little thing was snorting\\nlike a steamengine when she caught it and kept doubling itself up and\\nstraightening itself out again so that altogether for the first minute\\nor two it was as much as she could do to hold it\\nas soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it which was to\\ntwist it up into a sort of knot and then keep tight hold of its right\\near and left foot so as to prevent its undoing itself she carried\\nit out into the open air if i dont take this child away with me\\nthought alice theyre sure to kill it in a day or two wouldnt it be\\nmurder to leave it behind she said the last words out loud and the\\nlittle thing grunted in reply it had left off sneezing by this time\\ndont grunt said alice thats not at all a proper way of expressing\\nyourself\\nthe baby grunted again and alice looked very anxiously into its face to\\nsee what was the matter with it there could be no doubt that it had\\na very turnup nose much more like a snout than a real nose also its\\neyes were getting extremely small for a baby altogether alice did not\\nlike the look of the thing at all but perhaps it was only sobbing\\nshe thought and looked into its eyes again to see if there were any\\ntears\\nno there were no tears if youre going to turn into a pig my dear\\nsaid alice seriously ill have nothing more to do with you mind\\nnow the poor little thing sobbed again or grunted it was impossible\\nto say which and they went on for some while in silence\\nalice was just beginning to think to herself now what am i to do with\\nthis creature when i get it home when it grunted again so violently\\nthat she looked down into its face in some alarm this time there could\\nbe no mistake about it it was neither more nor less than a pig and she\\nfelt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further\\nso she set the little creature down and felt quite relieved to see\\nit trot away quietly into the wood if it had grown up she said\\nto herself it would have made a dreadfully ugly child but it makes\\nrather a handsome pig i think and she began thinking over other\\nchildren she knew who might do very well as pigs and was just saying\\nto herself if one only knew the right way to change them when she\\nwas a little startled by seeing the cheshire cat sitting on a bough of a\\ntree a few yards off\\nthe cat only grinned when it saw alice it looked goodnatured she\\nthought still it had very long claws and a great many teeth so she\\nfelt that it ought to be treated with respect\\ncheshire puss she began rather timidly as she did not at all know\\nwhether it would like the name however it only grinned a little wider\\ncome its pleased so far thought alice and she went on would you\\ntell me please which way i ought to go from here\\nthat depends a good deal on where you want to get to said the cat\\ni dont much care where said alice\\nthen it doesnt matter which way you go said the cat\\nso long as i get somewhere alice added as an explanation\\noh youre sure to do that said the cat if you only walk long\\nenough\\nalice felt that this could not be denied so she tried another question\\nwhat sort of people live about here\\nin that direction the cat said waving its right paw round lives\\na hatter and in that direction waving the other paw lives a march\\nhare visit either you like theyre both mad\\nbut i dont want to go among mad people alice remarked\\noh you cant help that said the cat were all mad here im mad\\nyoure mad\\nhow do you know im mad said alice\\nyou must be said the cat or you wouldnt have come here\\nalice didnt think that proved it at all however she went on and how\\ndo you know that youre mad\\nto begin with said the cat a dogs not mad you grant that\\ni suppose so said alice\\nwell then the cat went on you see a dog growls when its angry\\nand wags its tail when its pleased now i growl when im pleased and\\nwag my tail when im angry therefore im mad\\ni call it purring not growling said alice\\ncall it what you like said the cat do you play croquet with the\\nqueen today\\ni should like it very much said alice but i havent been invited\\nyet\\nyoull see me there said the cat and vanished\\nalice was not much surprised at this she was getting so used to queer\\nthings happening while she was looking at the place where it had been\\nit suddenly appeared again\\nbythebye what became of the baby said the cat id nearly\\nforgotten to ask\\nit turned into a pig alice quietly said just as if it had come back\\nin a natural way\\ni thought it would said the cat and vanished again\\nalice waited a little half expecting to see it again but it did not\\nappear and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in\\nwhich the march hare was said to live ive seen hatters before she\\nsaid to herself the march hare will be much the most interesting and\\nperhaps as this is may it wont be raving madat least not so mad as\\nit was in march as she said this she looked up and there was the cat\\nagain sitting on a branch of a tree\\ndid you say pig or fig said the cat\\ni said pig replied alice and i wish you wouldnt keep appearing and\\nvanishing so suddenly you make one quite giddy\\nall right said the cat and this time it vanished quite slowly\\nbeginning with the end of the tail and ending with the grin which\\nremained some time after the rest of it had gone\\nwell ive often seen a cat without a grin thought alice but a grin\\nwithout a cat its the most curious thing i ever saw in my life\\nshe had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house\\nof the march hare she thought it must be the right house because the\\nchimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur it\\nwas so large a house that she did not like to go nearer till she had\\nnibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom and raised herself to\\nabout two feet high even then she walked up towards it rather timidly\\nsaying to herself suppose it should be raving mad after all i almost\\nwish id gone to see the hatter instead\\nthere was a table set out under a tree in front of the house and the\\nmarch hare and the hatter were having tea at it a dormouse was sitting\\nbetween them fast asleep and the other two were using it as a\\ncushion resting their elbows on it and talking over its head very\\nuncomfortable for the dormouse thought alice only as its asleep i\\nsuppose it doesnt mind\\nthe table was a large one but the three were all crowded together at\\none corner of it no room no room they cried out when they saw alice\\ncoming theres plenty of room said alice indignantly and she sat\\ndown in a large armchair at one end of the table\\nhave some wine the march hare said in an encouraging tone\\nalice looked all round the table but there was nothing on it but tea\\ni dont see any wine she remarked\\nthere isnt any said the march hare\\nthen it wasnt very civil of you to offer it said alice angrily\\nit wasnt very civil of you to sit down without being invited said\\nthe march hare\\ni didnt know it was your table said alice its laid for a great\\nmany more than three\\nyour hair wants cutting said the hatter he had been looking at alice\\nfor some time with great curiosity and this was his first speech\\nyou should learn not to make personal remarks alice said with some\\nseverity its very rude\\nthe hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this but all he said\\nwas why is a raven like a writingdesk\\ncome we shall have some fun now thought alice im glad theyve\\nbegun asking riddlesi believe i can guess that she added aloud\\ndo you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it said the\\nmarch hare\\nexactly so said alice\\nthen you should say what you mean the march hare went on\\ni do alice hastily replied at leastat least i mean what i\\nsaythats the same thing you know\\nnot the same thing a bit said the hatter you might just as well say\\nthat i see what i eat is the same thing as i eat what i see\\nyou might just as well say added the march hare that i like what i\\nget is the same thing as i get what i like\\nyou might just as well say added the dormouse who seemed to be\\ntalking in his sleep that i breathe when i sleep is the same thing\\nas i sleep when i breathe\\nit is the same thing with you said the hatter and here the\\nconversation dropped and the party sat silent for a minute while alice\\nthought over all she could remember about ravens and writingdesks\\nwhich wasnt much\\nthe hatter was the first to break the silence what day of the month\\nis it he said turning to alice he had taken his watch out of his\\npocket and was looking at it uneasily shaking it every now and then\\nand holding it to his ear\\nalice considered a little and then said the fourth\\ntwo days wrong sighed the hatter i told you butter wouldnt suit\\nthe works he added looking angrily at the march hare\\nit was the best butter the march hare meekly replied\\nyes but some crumbs must have got in as well the hatter grumbled\\nyou shouldnt have put it in with the breadknife\\nthe march hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily then he dipped\\nit into his cup of tea and looked at it again but he could think of\\nnothing better to say than his first remark it was the best butter\\nyou know\\nalice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity what a\\nfunny watch she remarked it tells the day of the month and doesnt\\ntell what oclock it is\\nwhy should it muttered the hatter does your watch tell you what\\nyear it is\\nof course not alice replied very readily but thats because it\\nstays the same year for such a long time together\\nwhich is just the case with mine said the hatter\\nalice felt dreadfully puzzled the hatters remark seemed to have no\\nsort of meaning in it and yet it was certainly english i dont quite\\nunderstand you she said as politely as she could\\nthe dormouse is asleep again said the hatter and he poured a little\\nhot tea upon its nose\\nthe dormouse shook its head impatiently and said without opening its\\neyes of course of course just what i was going to remark myself\\nhave you guessed the riddle yet the hatter said turning to alice\\nagain\\nno i give it up alice replied whats the answer\\ni havent the slightest idea said the hatter\\nnor i said the march hare\\nalice sighed wearily i think you might do something better with the\\ntime she said than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers\\nif you knew time as well as i do said the hatter you wouldnt talk\\nabout wasting it its him\\ni dont know what you mean said alice\\nof course you dont the hatter said tossing his head contemptuously\\ni dare say you never even spoke to time\\nperhaps not alice cautiously replied but i know i have to beat time\\nwhen i learn music\\nah that accounts for it said the hatter he wont stand beating\\nnow if you only kept on good terms with him hed do almost anything\\nyou liked with the clock for instance suppose it were nine oclock in\\nthe morning just time to begin lessons youd only have to whisper a\\nhint to time and round goes the clock in a twinkling halfpast one\\ntime for dinner\\ni only wish it was the march hare said to itself in a whisper\\nthat would be grand certainly said alice thoughtfully but theni\\nshouldnt be hungry for it you know\\nnot at first perhaps said the hatter but you could keep it to\\nhalfpast one as long as you liked\\nis that the way you manage alice asked\\nthe hatter shook his head mournfully not i he replied we\\nquarrelled last marchjust before he went mad you know pointing\\nwith his tea spoon at the march hare it was at the great concert\\ngiven by the queen of hearts and i had to sing\\n     twinkle twinkle little bat\\n     how i wonder what youre at\\nyou know the song perhaps\\nive heard something like it said alice\\nit goes on you know the hatter continued in this way\\n     up above the world you fly\\n     like a teatray in the sky\\n         twinkle twinkle\\nhere the dormouse shook itself and began singing in its sleep twinkle\\ntwinkle twinkle twinkle and went on so long that they had to pinch\\nit to make it stop\\nwell id hardly finished the first verse said the hatter when the\\nqueen jumped up and bawled out hes murdering the time off with his\\nhead\\nhow dreadfully savage exclaimed alice\\nand ever since that the hatter went on in a mournful tone he wont\\ndo a thing i ask its always six oclock now\\na bright idea came into alices head is that the reason so many\\nteathings are put out here she asked\\nyes thats it said the hatter with a sigh its always teatime\\nand weve no time to wash the things between whiles\\nthen you keep moving round i suppose said alice\\nexactly so said the hatter as the things get used up\\nbut what happens when you come to the beginning again alice ventured\\nto ask\\nsuppose we change the subject the march hare interrupted yawning\\nim getting tired of this i vote the young lady tells us a story\\nim afraid i dont know one said alice rather alarmed at the\\nproposal\\nthen the dormouse shall they both cried wake up dormouse and\\nthey pinched it on both sides at once\\nthe dormouse slowly opened his eyes i wasnt asleep he said in a\\nhoarse feeble voice i heard every word you fellows were saying\\ntell us a story said the march hare\\nyes please do pleaded alice\\nand be quick about it added the hatter or youll be asleep again\\nbefore its done\\nonce upon a time there were three little sisters the dormouse began\\nin a great hurry and their names were elsie lacie and tillie and\\nthey lived at the bottom of a well\\nwhat did they live on said alice who always took a great interest in\\nquestions of eating and drinking\\nthey lived on treacle said the dormouse after thinking a minute or\\ntwo\\nthey couldnt have done that you know alice gently remarked theyd\\nhave been ill\\nso they were said the dormouse very ill\\nalice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of\\nliving would be like but it puzzled her too much so she went on but\\nwhy did they live at the bottom of a well\\ntake some more tea the march hare said to alice very earnestly\\nive had nothing yet alice replied in an offended tone so i cant\\ntake more\\nyou mean you cant take less said the hatter its very easy to take\\nmore than nothing\\nnobody asked your opinion said alice\\nwhos making personal remarks now the hatter asked triumphantly\\nalice did not quite know what to say to this so she helped herself\\nto some tea and breadandbutter and then turned to the dormouse and\\nrepeated her question why did they live at the bottom of a well\\nthe dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it and then\\nsaid it was a treaclewell\\ntheres no such thing alice was beginning very angrily but the\\nhatter and the march hare went sh sh and the dormouse sulkily\\nremarked if you cant be civil youd better finish the story for\\nyourself\\nno please go on alice said very humbly i wont interrupt again i\\ndare say there may be one\\none indeed said the dormouse indignantly however he consented to\\ngo on and so these three little sistersthey were learning to draw\\nyou know\\nwhat did they draw said alice quite forgetting her promise\\ntreacle said the dormouse without considering at all this time\\ni want a clean cup interrupted the hatter lets all move one place\\non\\nhe moved on as he spoke and the dormouse followed him the march hare\\nmoved into the dormouses place and alice rather unwillingly took\\nthe place of the march hare the hatter was the only one who got any\\nadvantage from the change and alice was a good deal worse off than\\nbefore as the march hare had just upset the milkjug into his plate\\nalice did not wish to offend the dormouse again so she began very\\ncautiously but i dont understand where did they draw the treacle\\nfrom\\nyou can draw water out of a waterwell said the hatter so i should\\nthink you could draw treacle out of a treaclewelleh stupid\\nbut they were in the well alice said to the dormouse not choosing to\\nnotice this last remark\\nof course they were said the dormouse well in\\nthis answer so confused poor alice that she let the dormouse go on for\\nsome time without interrupting it\\nthey were learning to draw the dormouse went on yawning and rubbing\\nits eyes for it was getting very sleepy and they drew all manner of\\nthingseverything that begins with an m\\nwhy with an m said alice\\nwhy not said the march hare\\nalice was silent\\nthe dormouse had closed its eyes by this time and was going off into\\na doze but on being pinched by the hatter it woke up again with\\na little shriek and went on that begins with an m such as\\nmousetraps and the moon and memory and muchnessyou know you say\\nthings are much of a muchnessdid you ever see such a thing as a\\ndrawing of a muchness\\nreally now you ask me said alice very much confused i dont\\nthink\\nthen you shouldnt talk said the hatter\\nthis piece of rudeness was more than alice could bear she got up in\\ngreat disgust and walked off the dormouse fell asleep instantly and\\nneither of the others took the least notice of her going though she\\nlooked back once or twice half hoping that they would call after her\\nthe last time she saw them they were trying to put the dormouse into\\nthe teapot\\nat any rate ill never go there again said alice as she picked her\\nway through the wood its the stupidest teaparty i ever was at in all\\nmy life\\njust as she said this she noticed that one of the trees had a door\\nleading right into it thats very curious she thought but\\neverythings curious today i think i may as well go in at once and in\\nshe went\\nonce more she found herself in the long hall and close to the little\\nglass table now ill manage better this time she said to herself\\nand began by taking the little golden key and unlocking the door that\\nled into the garden then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom she\\nhad kept a piece of it in her pocket till she was about a foot high\\nthen she walked down the little passage and thenshe found herself at\\nlast in the beautiful garden among the bright flowerbeds and the cool\\nfountains\\na large rosetree stood near the entrance of the garden the roses\\ngrowing on it were white but there were three gardeners at it busily\\npainting them red alice thought this a very curious thing and she went\\nnearer to watch them and just as she came up to them she heard one of\\nthem say look out now five dont go splashing paint over me like\\nthat\\ni couldnt help it said five in a sulky tone seven jogged my\\nelbow\\non which seven looked up and said thats right five always lay the\\nblame on others\\nyoud better not talk said five i heard the queen say only\\nyesterday you deserved to be beheaded\\nwhat for said the one who had spoken first\\nthats none of your business two said seven\\nyes it is his business said five and ill tell himit was for\\nbringing the cook tuliproots instead of onions\\nseven flung down his brush and had just begun well of all the unjust\\nthings when his eye chanced to fall upon alice as she stood watching\\nthem and he checked himself suddenly the others looked round also and\\nall of them bowed low\\nwould you tell me said alice a little timidly why you are painting\\nthose roses\\nfive and seven said nothing but looked at two two began in a low\\nvoice why the fact is you see miss this here ought to have been a\\nred rosetree and we put a white one in by mistake and if the queen\\nwas to find it out we should all have our heads cut off you know\\nso you see miss were doing our best afore she comes to at this\\nmoment five who had been anxiously looking across the garden called\\nout the queen the queen and the three gardeners instantly threw\\nthemselves flat upon their faces there was a sound of many footsteps\\nand alice looked round eager to see the queen\\nfirst came ten soldiers carrying clubs these were all shaped like\\nthe three gardeners oblong and flat with their hands and feet at the\\ncorners next the ten courtiers these were ornamented all over with\\ndiamonds and walked two and two as the soldiers did after these came\\nthe royal children there were ten of them and the little dears came\\njumping merrily along hand in hand in couples they were all ornamented\\nwith hearts next came the guests mostly kings and queens and among\\nthem alice recognised the white rabbit it was talking in a hurried\\nnervous manner smiling at everything that was said and went by without\\nnoticing her then followed the knave of hearts carrying the kings\\ncrown on a crimson velvet cushion and last of all this grand\\nprocession came the king and queen of hearts\\nalice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face\\nlike the three gardeners but she could not remember ever having heard\\nof such a rule at processions and besides what would be the use of\\na procession thought she if people had all to lie down upon their\\nfaces so that they couldnt see it so she stood still where she was\\nand waited\\nwhen the procession came opposite to alice they all stopped and looked\\nat her and the queen said severely who is this she said it to the\\nknave of hearts who only bowed and smiled in reply\\nidiot said the queen tossing her head impatiently and turning to\\nalice she went on whats your name child\\nmy name is alice so please your majesty said alice very politely\\nbut she added to herself why theyre only a pack of cards after\\nall i neednt be afraid of them\\nand who are these said the queen pointing to the three gardeners who\\nwere lying round the rosetree for you see as they were lying on their\\nfaces and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the\\npack she could not tell whether they were gardeners or soldiers or\\ncourtiers or three of her own children\\nhow should i know said alice surprised at her own courage its no\\nbusiness of mine\\nthe queen turned crimson with fury and after glaring at her for a\\nmoment like a wild beast screamed off with her head off\\nnonsense said alice very loudly and decidedly and the queen was\\nsilent\\nthe king laid his hand upon her arm and timidly said consider my\\ndear she is only a child\\nthe queen turned angrily away from him and said to the knave turn them\\nover\\nthe knave did so very carefully with one foot\\nget up said the queen in a shrill loud voice and the three\\ngardeners instantly jumped up and began bowing to the king the queen\\nthe royal children and everybody else\\nleave off that screamed the queen you make me giddy and then\\nturning to the rosetree she went on what have you been doing here\\nmay it please your majesty said two in a very humble tone going\\ndown on one knee as he spoke we were trying\\ni see said the queen who had meanwhile been examining the roses\\noff with their heads and the procession moved on three of the\\nsoldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners who ran\\nto alice for protection\\nyou shant be beheaded said alice and she put them into a large\\nflowerpot that stood near the three soldiers wandered about for a\\nminute or two looking for them and then quietly marched off after the\\nothers\\nare their heads off shouted the queen\\ntheir heads are gone if it please your majesty the soldiers shouted\\nin reply\\nthats right shouted the queen can you play croquet\\nthe soldiers were silent and looked at alice as the question was\\nevidently meant for her\\nyes shouted alice\\ncome on then roared the queen and alice joined the procession\\nwondering very much what would happen next\\nitsits a very fine day said a timid voice at her side she was\\nwalking by the white rabbit who was peeping anxiously into her face\\nvery said alice wheres the duchess\\nhush hush said the rabbit in a low hurried tone he looked\\nanxiously over his shoulder as he spoke and then raised himself upon\\ntiptoe put his mouth close to her ear and whispered shes under\\nsentence of execution\\nwhat for said alice\\ndid you say what a pity the rabbit asked\\nno i didnt said alice i dont think its at all a pity i said\\nwhat for\\nshe boxed the queens ears the rabbit began alice gave a little\\nscream of laughter oh hush the rabbit whispered in a frightened\\ntone the queen will hear you you see she came rather late and the\\nqueen said\\nget to your places shouted the queen in a voice of thunder and\\npeople began running about in all directions tumbling up against each\\nother however they got settled down in a minute or two and the game\\nbegan alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquetground in\\nher life it was all ridges and furrows the balls were live hedgehogs\\nthe mallets live flamingoes and the soldiers had to double themselves\\nup and to stand on their hands and feet to make the arches\\nthe chief difficulty alice found at first was in managing her flamingo\\nshe succeeded in getting its body tucked away comfortably enough under\\nher arm with its legs hanging down but generally just as she had got\\nits neck nicely straightened out and was going to give the hedgehog a\\nblow with its head it would twist itself round and look up in her face\\nwith such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out\\nlaughing and when she had got its head down and was going to begin\\nagain it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled\\nitself and was in the act of crawling away besides all this there was\\ngenerally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the\\nhedgehog to and as the doubledup soldiers were always getting up\\nand walking off to other parts of the ground alice soon came to the\\nconclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed\\nthe players all played at once without waiting for turns quarrelling\\nall the while and fighting for the hedgehogs and in a very short\\ntime the queen was in a furious passion and went stamping about and\\nshouting off with his head or off with her head about once in a\\nminute\\nalice began to feel very uneasy to be sure she had not as yet had any\\ndispute with the queen but she knew that it might happen any minute\\nand then thought she what would become of me theyre dreadfully\\nfond of beheading people here the great wonder is that theres any one\\nleft alive\\nshe was looking about for some way of escape and wondering whether she\\ncould get away without being seen when she noticed a curious appearance\\nin the air it puzzled her very much at first but after watching it\\na minute or two she made it out to be a grin and she said to herself\\nits the cheshire cat now i shall have somebody to talk to\\nhow are you getting on said the cat as soon as there was mouth\\nenough for it to speak with\\nalice waited till the eyes appeared and then nodded its no use\\nspeaking to it she thought till its ears have come or at least one\\nof them in another minute the whole head appeared and then alice put\\ndown her flamingo and began an account of the game feeling very glad\\nshe had someone to listen to her the cat seemed to think that there was\\nenough of it now in sight and no more of it appeared\\ni dont think they play at all fairly alice began in rather a\\ncomplaining tone and they all quarrel so dreadfully one cant hear\\noneself speakand they dont seem to have any rules in particular\\nat least if there are nobody attends to themand youve no idea how\\nconfusing it is all the things being alive for instance theres the\\narch ive got to go through next walking about at the other end of the\\ngroundand i should have croqueted the queens hedgehog just now only\\nit ran away when it saw mine coming\\nhow do you like the queen said the cat in a low voice\\nnot at all said alice shes so extremely just then she noticed\\nthat the queen was close behind her listening so she went on\\nlikely to win that its hardly worth while finishing the game\\nthe queen smiled and passed on\\nwho are you talking to said the king going up to alice and looking\\nat the cats head with great curiosity\\nits a friend of minea cheshire cat said alice allow me to\\nintroduce it\\ni dont like the look of it at all said the king however it may\\nkiss my hand if it likes\\nid rather not the cat remarked\\ndont be impertinent said the king and dont look at me like that\\nhe got behind alice as he spoke\\na cat may look at a king said alice ive read that in some book\\nbut i dont remember where\\nwell it must be removed said the king very decidedly and he called\\nthe queen who was passing at the moment my dear i wish you would\\nhave this cat removed\\nthe queen had only one way of settling all difficulties great or small\\noff with his head she said without even looking round\\nill fetch the executioner myself said the king eagerly and he\\nhurried off\\nalice thought she might as well go back and see how the game was going\\non as she heard the queens voice in the distance screaming with\\npassion she had already heard her sentence three of the players to be\\nexecuted for having missed their turns and she did not like the look\\nof things at all as the game was in such confusion that she never knew\\nwhether it was her turn or not so she went in search of her hedgehog\\nthe hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog which seemed\\nto alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the\\nother the only difficulty was that her flamingo was gone across to the\\nother side of the garden where alice could see it trying in a helpless\\nsort of way to fly up into a tree\\nby the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back the fight\\nwas over and both the hedgehogs were out of sight but it doesnt\\nmatter much thought alice as all the arches are gone from this side\\nof the ground so she tucked it away under her arm that it might not\\nescape again and went back for a little more conversation with her\\nfriend\\nwhen she got back to the cheshire cat she was surprised to find quite a\\nlarge crowd collected round it there was a dispute going on between\\nthe executioner the king and the queen who were all talking at once\\nwhile all the rest were quite silent and looked very uncomfortable\\nthe moment alice appeared she was appealed to by all three to settle\\nthe question and they repeated their arguments to her though as they\\nall spoke at once she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly\\nwhat they said\\nthe executioners argument was that you couldnt cut off a head unless\\nthere was a body to cut it off from that he had never had to do such a\\nthing before and he wasnt going to begin at his time of life\\nthe kings argument was that anything that had a head could be\\nbeheaded and that you werent to talk nonsense\\nthe queens argument was that if something wasnt done about it in less\\nthan no time shed have everybody executed all round it was this last\\nremark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious\\nalice could think of nothing else to say but it belongs to the duchess\\nyoud better ask her about it\\nshes in prison the queen said to the executioner fetch her here\\nand the executioner went off like an arrow\\n the cats head began fading away the moment he was gone and\\nby the time he had come back with the duchess it had entirely\\ndisappeared so the king and the executioner ran wildly up and down\\nlooking for it while the rest of the party went back to the game\\nyou cant think how glad i am to see you again you dear old thing\\nsaid the duchess as she tucked her arm affectionately into alices and\\nthey walked off together\\nalice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper and thought\\nto herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so\\nsavage when they met in the kitchen\\nwhen im a duchess she said to herself not in a very hopeful tone\\nthough i wont have any pepper in my kitchen at all soup does very\\nwell withoutmaybe its always pepper that makes people hottempered\\nshe went on very much pleased at having found out a new kind of\\nrule and vinegar that makes them sourand camomile that makes\\nthem bitterandand barleysugar and such things that make children\\nsweettempered i only wish people knew that then they wouldnt be so\\nstingy about it you know\\nshe had quite forgotten the duchess by this time and was a little\\nstartled when she heard her voice close to her ear youre thinking\\nabout something my dear and that makes you forget to talk i cant\\ntell you just now what the moral of that is but i shall remember it in\\na bit\\nperhaps it hasnt one alice ventured to remark\\ntut tut child said the duchess everythings got a moral if only\\nyou can find it and she squeezed herself up closer to alices side as\\nshe spoke\\nalice did not much like keeping so close to her first because the\\nduchess was very ugly and secondly because she was exactly the\\nright height to rest her chin upon alices shoulder and it was an\\nuncomfortably sharp chin however she did not like to be rude so she\\nbore it as well as she could\\nthe games going on rather better now she said by way of keeping up\\nthe conversation a little\\ntis so said the duchess and the moral of that isoh tis love\\ntis love that makes the world go round\\nsomebody said alice whispered that its done by everybody minding\\ntheir own business\\nah well it means much the same thing said the duchess digging her\\nsharp little chin into alices shoulder as she added and the moral\\nof that istake care of the sense and the sounds will take care of\\nthemselves\\nhow fond she is of finding morals in things alice thought to herself\\ni dare say youre wondering why i dont put my arm round your waist\\nthe duchess said after a pause the reason is that im doubtful about\\nthe temper of your flamingo shall i try the experiment\\nhe might bite alice cautiously replied not feeling at all anxious to\\nhave the experiment tried\\nvery true said the duchess flamingoes and mustard both bite and\\nthe moral of that isbirds of a feather flock together\\nonly mustard isnt a bird alice remarked\\nright as usual said the duchess what a clear way you have of\\nputting things\\nits a mineral i think said alice\\nof course it is said the duchess who seemed ready to agree to\\neverything that alice said theres a large mustardmine near here and\\nthe moral of that isthe more there is of mine the less there is of\\nyours\\noh i know exclaimed alice who had not attended to this last remark\\nits a vegetable it doesnt look like one but it is\\ni quite agree with you said the duchess and the moral of that\\nisbe what you would seem to beor if youd like it put more\\nsimplynever imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might\\nappear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise\\nthan what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise\\ni think i should understand that better alice said very politely if\\ni had it written down but i cant quite follow it as you say it\\nthats nothing to what i could say if i chose the duchess replied in\\na pleased tone\\npray dont trouble yourself to say it any longer than that said\\nalice\\noh dont talk about trouble said the duchess i make you a present\\nof everything ive said as yet\\na cheap sort of present thought alice im glad they dont give\\nbirthday presents like that but she did not venture to say it out\\nloud\\nthinking again the duchess asked with another dig of her sharp\\nlittle chin\\nive a right to think said alice sharply for she was beginning to\\nfeel a little worried\\njust about as much right said the duchess as pigs have to fly and\\nthe m\\nbut here to alices great surprise the duchesss voice died away even\\nin the middle of her favourite word moral and the arm that was linked\\ninto hers began to tremble alice looked up and there stood the queen\\nin front of them with her arms folded frowning like a thunderstorm\\na fine day your majesty the duchess began in a low weak voice\\nnow i give you fair warning shouted the queen stamping on the\\nground as she spoke either you or your head must be off and that in\\nabout half no time take your choice\\nthe duchess took her choice and was gone in a moment\\nlets go on with the game the queen said to alice and alice was\\ntoo much frightened to say a word but slowly followed her back to the\\ncroquetground\\nthe other guests had taken advantage of the queens absence and were\\nresting in the shade however the moment they saw her they hurried\\nback to the game the queen merely remarking that a moments delay would\\ncost them their lives\\nall the time they were playing the queen never left off quarrelling with\\nthe other players and shouting off with his head or off with her\\nhead those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers\\nwho of course had to leave off being arches to do this so that by\\nthe end of half an hour or so there were no arches left and all the\\nplayers except the king the queen and alice were in custody and\\nunder sentence of execution\\nthen the queen left off quite out of breath and said to alice have\\nyou seen the mock turtle yet\\nno said alice i dont even know what a mock turtle is\\nits the thing mock turtle soup is made from said the queen\\ni never saw one or heard of one said alice\\ncome on then said the queen and he shall tell you his history\\nas they walked off together alice heard the king say in a low voice\\nto the company generally you are all pardoned come thats a good\\nthing she said to herself for she had felt quite unhappy at the\\nnumber of executions the queen had ordered\\nthey very soon came upon a gryphon lying fast asleep in the sun\\nif you dont know what a gryphon is look at the picture up lazy\\nthing said the queen and take this young lady to see the mock\\nturtle and to hear his history i must go back and see after some\\nexecutions i have ordered and she walked off leaving alice alone with\\nthe gryphon alice did not quite like the look of the creature but on\\nthe whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go\\nafter that savage queen so she waited\\nthe gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes then it watched the queen till\\nshe was out of sight then it chuckled what fun said the gryphon\\nhalf to itself half to alice\\nwhat is the fun said alice\\nwhy she said the gryphon its all her fancy that they never\\nexecutes nobody you know come on\\neverybody says come on here thought alice as she went slowly\\nafter it i never was so ordered about in all my life never\\nthey had not gone far before they saw the mock turtle in the distance\\nsitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock and as they came\\nnearer alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break she\\npitied him deeply what is his sorrow she asked the gryphon and the\\ngryphon answered very nearly in the same words as before its all his\\nfancy that he hasnt got no sorrow you know come on\\nso they went up to the mock turtle who looked at them with large eyes\\nfull of tears but said nothing\\nthis here young lady said the gryphon she wants for to know your\\nhistory she do\\nill tell it her said the mock turtle in a deep hollow tone sit\\ndown both of you and dont speak a word till ive finished\\nso they sat down and nobody spoke for some minutes alice thought to\\nherself i dont see how he can even finish if he doesnt begin but\\nshe waited patiently\\nonce said the mock turtle at last with a deep sigh i was a real\\nturtle\\nthese words were followed by a very long silence broken only by an\\noccasional exclamation of hjckrrh from the gryphon and the constant\\nheavy sobbing of the mock turtle alice was very nearly getting up and\\nsaying thank you sir for your interesting story but she could\\nnot help thinking there must be more to come so she sat still and said\\nnothing\\nwhen we were little the mock turtle went on at last more calmly\\nthough still sobbing a little now and then we went to school in the\\nsea the master was an old turtlewe used to call him tortoise\\nwhy did you call him tortoise if he wasnt one alice asked\\nwe called him tortoise because he taught us said the mock turtle\\nangrily really you are very dull\\nyou ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question\\nadded the gryphon and then they both sat silent and looked at poor\\nalice who felt ready to sink into the earth at last the gryphon said\\nto the mock turtle drive on old fellow dont be all day about it\\nand he went on in these words\\nyes we went to school in the sea though you maynt believe it\\ni never said i didnt interrupted alice\\nyou did said the mock turtle\\nhold your tongue added the gryphon before alice could speak again\\nthe mock turtle went on\\nwe had the best of educationsin fact we went to school every day\\nive been to a dayschool too said alice you neednt be so proud\\nas all that\\nwith extras asked the mock turtle a little anxiously\\nyes said alice we learned french and music\\nand washing said the mock turtle\\ncertainly not said alice indignantly\\nah then yours wasnt a really good school said the mock turtle in\\na tone of great relief now at ours they had at the end of the bill\\nfrench music and washingextra\\nyou couldnt have wanted it much said alice living at the bottom of\\nthe sea\\ni couldnt afford to learn it said the mock turtle with a sigh i\\nonly took the regular course\\nwhat was that inquired alice\\nreeling and writhing of course to begin with the mock turtle\\nreplied and then the different branches of arithmeticambition\\ndistraction uglification and derision\\ni never heard of uglification alice ventured to say what is it\\nthe gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise what never heard of\\nuglifying it exclaimed you know what to beautify is i suppose\\nyes said alice doubtfully it meanstomakeanythingprettier\\nwell then the gryphon went on if you dont know what to uglify is\\nyou are a simpleton\\nalice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it so she\\nturned to the mock turtle and said what else had you to learn\\nwell there was mystery the mock turtle replied counting off\\nthe subjects on his flappers mystery ancient and modern with\\nseaography then drawlingthe drawlingmaster was an old congereel\\nthat used to come once a week he taught us drawling stretching and\\nfainting in coils\\nwhat was that like said alice\\nwell i cant show it you myself the mock turtle said im too\\nstiff and the gryphon never learnt it\\nhadnt time said the gryphon i went to the classics master though\\nhe was an old crab he was\\ni never went to him the mock turtle said with a sigh he taught\\nlaughing and grief they used to say\\nso he did so he did said the gryphon sighing in his turn and both\\ncreatures hid their faces in their paws\\nand how many hours a day did you do lessons said alice in a hurry to\\nchange the subject\\nten hours the first day said the mock turtle nine the next and so\\non\\nwhat a curious plan exclaimed alice\\nthats the reason theyre called lessons the gryphon remarked\\nbecause they lessen from day to day\\nthis was quite a new idea to alice and she thought it over a little\\nbefore she made her next remark then the eleventh day must have been a\\nholiday\\nof course it was said the mock turtle\\nand how did you manage on the twelfth alice went on eagerly\\nthats enough about lessons the gryphon interrupted in a very decided\\ntone tell her something about the games now\\nthe mock turtle sighed deeply and drew the back of one flapper across\\nhis eyes he looked at alice and tried to speak but for a minute or\\ntwo sobs choked his voice same as if he had a bone in his throat\\nsaid the gryphon and it set to work shaking him and punching him in\\nthe back at last the mock turtle recovered his voice and with tears\\nrunning down his cheeks he went on again\\nyou may not have lived much under the sea i havent said\\naliceand perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster\\nalice began to say i once tasted but checked herself hastily and\\nsaid no never so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a\\nlobster quadrille is\\nno indeed said alice what sort of a dance is it\\nwhy said the gryphon you first form into a line along the\\nseashore\\ntwo lines cried the mock turtle seals turtles salmon and so on\\nthen when youve cleared all the jellyfish out of the way\\nthat generally takes some time interrupted the gryphon\\nyou advance twice\\neach with a lobster as a partner cried the gryphon\\nof course the mock turtle said advance twice set to partners\\nchange lobsters and retire in same order continued the gryphon\\nthen you know the mock turtle went on you throw the\\nthe lobsters shouted the gryphon with a bound into the air\\nas far out to sea as you can\\nswim after them screamed the gryphon\\nturn a somersault in the sea cried the mock turtle capering wildly\\nabout\\nchange lobsters again yelled the gryphon at the top of its voice\\nback to land again and thats all the first figure said the mock\\nturtle suddenly dropping his voice and the two creatures who had been\\njumping about like mad things all this time sat down again very sadly\\nand quietly and looked at alice\\nit must be a very pretty dance said alice timidly\\nwould you like to see a little of it said the mock turtle\\nvery much indeed said alice\\ncome lets try the first figure said the mock turtle to the gryphon\\nwe can do without lobsters you know which shall sing\\noh you sing said the gryphon ive forgotten the words\\nso they began solemnly dancing round and round alice every now and\\nthen treading on her toes when they passed too close and waving their\\nforepaws to mark the time while the mock turtle sang this very slowly\\nand sadly\\n will you walk a little faster said a whiting to a snail\\n theres a porpoise close behind us and hes treading on my tail\\n see how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance\\n they are waiting on the shinglewill you come and join the dance\\n will you wont you will you wont you will you join the dance\\n will you wont you will you wont you wont you join the dance\\n you can really have no notion how delightful it will be\\n when they take us up and throw us with the lobsters out to sea\\n but the snail replied too far too far and gave a look askance\\n said he thanked the whiting kindly but he would not join the dance\\n would not could not would not could not would not join the dance\\n would not could not would not could not could not join the dance\\n what matters it how far we go his scaly friend replied\\n there is another shore you know upon the other side\\n the further off from england the nearer is to france\\n then turn not pale beloved snail but come and join the dance\\n will you wont you will you wont you will you join the dance\\n will you wont you will you wont you wont you join the dance\\nthank you its a very interesting dance to watch said alice feeling\\nvery glad that it was over at last and i do so like that curious song\\nabout the whiting\\noh as to the whiting said the mock turtle theyyouve seen them\\nof course\\nyes said alice ive often seen them at dinn she checked herself\\nhastily\\ni dont know where dinn may be said the mock turtle but if youve\\nseen them so often of course you know what theyre like\\ni believe so alice replied thoughtfully they have their tails in\\ntheir mouthsand theyre all over crumbs\\nyoure wrong about the crumbs said the mock turtle crumbs would all\\nwash off in the sea but they have their tails in their mouths and the\\nreason is here the mock turtle yawned and shut his eyestell her\\nabout the reason and all that he said to the gryphon\\nthe reason is said the gryphon that they would go with the lobsters\\nto the dance so they got thrown out to sea so they had to fall a long\\nway so they got their tails fast in their mouths so they couldnt get\\nthem out again thats all\\nthank you said alice its very interesting i never knew so much\\nabout a whiting before\\ni can tell you more than that if you like said the gryphon do you\\nknow why its called a whiting\\ni never thought about it said alice why\\nit does the boots and shoes the gryphon replied very solemnly\\nalice was thoroughly puzzled does the boots and shoes she repeated\\nin a wondering tone\\nwhy what are your shoes done with said the gryphon i mean what\\nmakes them so shiny\\nalice looked down at them and considered a little before she gave her\\nanswer theyre done with blacking i believe\\nboots and shoes under the sea the gryphon went on in a deep voice\\nare done with a whiting now you know\\nand what are they made of alice asked in a tone of great curiosity\\nsoles and eels of course the gryphon replied rather impatiently\\nany shrimp could have told you that\\nif id been the whiting said alice whose thoughts were still running\\non the song id have said to the porpoise keep back please we\\ndont want you with us\\nthey were obliged to have him with them the mock turtle said no\\nwise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise\\nwouldnt it really said alice in a tone of great surprise\\nof course not said the mock turtle why if a fish came to me and\\ntold me he was going a journey i should say with what porpoise\\ndont you mean purpose said alice\\ni mean what i say the mock turtle replied in an offended tone and\\nthe gryphon added come lets hear some of your adventures\\ni could tell you my adventuresbeginning from this morning said\\nalice a little timidly but its no use going back to yesterday\\nbecause i was a different person then\\nexplain all that said the mock turtle\\nno no the adventures first said the gryphon in an impatient tone\\nexplanations take such a dreadful time\\nso alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first\\nsaw the white rabbit she was a little nervous about it just at first\\nthe two creatures got so close to her one on each side and opened\\ntheir eyes and mouths so very wide but she gained courage as she went\\non her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about\\nher repeating you are old father william to the caterpillar and the\\nwords all coming different and then the mock turtle drew a long breath\\nand said thats very curious\\nits all about as curious as it can be said the gryphon\\nit all came different the mock turtle repeated thoughtfully i\\nshould like to hear her try and repeat something now tell her to\\nbegin he looked at the gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of\\nauthority over alice\\nstand up and repeat tis the voice of the sluggard said the\\ngryphon\\nhow the creatures order one about and make one repeat lessons\\nthought alice i might as well be at school at once however she\\ngot up and began to repeat it but her head was so full of the lobster\\nquadrille that she hardly knew what she was saying and the words came\\nvery queer indeed\\n  tis the voice of the lobster i heard him declare\\n  you have baked me too brown i must sugar my hair\\n  as a duck with its eyelids so he with his nose\\n  trims his belt and his buttons and turns out his toes\\n       later editions continued as follows\\n  when the sands are all dry he is gay as a lark\\n  and will talk in contemptuous tones of the shark\\n  but when the tide rises and sharks are around\\n  his voice has a timid and tremulous sound\\nthats different from what i used to say when i was a child said the\\ngryphon\\nwell i never heard it before said the mock turtle but it sounds\\nuncommon nonsense\\nalice said nothing she had sat down with her face in her hands\\nwondering if anything would ever happen in a natural way again\\ni should like to have it explained said the mock turtle\\nshe cant explain it said the gryphon hastily go on with the next\\nverse\\nbut about his toes the mock turtle persisted how could he turn them\\nout with his nose you know\\nits the first position in dancing alice said but was dreadfully\\npuzzled by the whole thing and longed to change the subject\\ngo on with the next verse the gryphon repeated impatiently it\\nbegins i passed by his garden\\nalice did not dare to disobey though she felt sure it would all come\\nwrong and she went on in a trembling voice\\n  i passed by his garden and marked with one eye\\n  how the owl and the panther were sharing a pie\\n    later editions continued as follows\\n  the panther took piecrust and gravy and meat\\n  while the owl had the dish as its share of the treat\\n  when the pie was all finished the owl as a boon\\n  was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon\\n  while the panther received knife and fork with a growl\\n  and concluded the banquet\\nwhat is the use of repeating all that stuff the mock turtle\\ninterrupted if you dont explain it as you go on its by far the most\\nconfusing thing i ever heard\\nyes i think youd better leave off said the gryphon and alice was\\nonly too glad to do so\\nshall we try another figure of the lobster quadrille the gryphon went\\non or would you like the mock turtle to sing you a song\\noh a song please if the mock turtle would be so kind alice\\nreplied so eagerly that the gryphon said in a rather offended tone\\nhm no accounting for tastes sing her turtle soup will you old\\nfellow\\nthe mock turtle sighed deeply and began in a voice sometimes choked\\nwith sobs to sing this\\n   beautiful soup so rich and green\\n   waiting in a hot tureen\\n   who for such dainties would not stoop\\n   soup of the evening beautiful soup\\n   soup of the evening beautiful soup\\n     beauootiful soooop\\n     beauootiful soooop\\n   soooop of the eeevening\\n     beautiful beautiful soup\\n   beautiful soup who cares for fish\\n   game or any other dish\\n   who would not give all else for two\\n   pennyworth only of beautiful soup\\n   pennyworth only of beautiful soup\\n     beauootiful soooop\\n     beauootiful soooop\\n   soooop of the eeevening\\n     beautiful beautiful soup\\nchorus again cried the gryphon and the mock turtle had just begun\\nto repeat it when a cry of the trials beginning was heard in the\\ndistance\\ncome on cried the gryphon and taking alice by the hand it hurried\\noff without waiting for the end of the song\\nwhat trial is it alice panted as she ran but the gryphon only\\nanswered come on and ran the faster while more and more faintly\\ncame carried on the breeze that followed them the melancholy words\\n   soooop of the eeevening\\n     beautiful beautiful soup\\nthe king and queen of hearts were seated on their throne when they\\narrived with a great crowd assembled about themall sorts of little\\nbirds and beasts as well as the whole pack of cards the knave was\\nstanding before them in chains with a soldier on each side to guard\\nhim and near the king was the white rabbit with a trumpet in one hand\\nand a scroll of parchment in the other in the very middle of the court\\nwas a table with a large dish of tarts upon it they looked so good\\nthat it made alice quite hungry to look at themi wish theyd get the\\ntrial done she thought and hand round the refreshments but there\\nseemed to be no chance of this so she began looking at everything about\\nher to pass away the time\\nalice had never been in a court of justice before but she had read\\nabout them in books and she was quite pleased to find that she knew\\nthe name of nearly everything there thats the judge she said to\\nherself because of his great wig\\nthe judge by the way was the king and as he wore his crown over the\\nwig look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it he did\\nnot look at all comfortable and it was certainly not becoming\\nand thats the jurybox thought alice and those twelve creatures\\nshe was obliged to say creatures you see because some of them were\\nanimals and some were birds i suppose they are the jurors she said\\nthis last word two or three times over to herself being rather proud of\\nit for she thought and rightly too that very few little girls of her\\nage knew the meaning of it at all however jurymen would have done\\njust as well\\nthe twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates what are they\\ndoing alice whispered to the gryphon they cant have anything to put\\ndown yet before the trials begun\\ntheyre putting down their names the gryphon whispered in reply for\\nfear they should forget them before the end of the trial\\nstupid things alice began in a loud indignant voice but she stopped\\nhastily for the white rabbit cried out silence in the court and the\\nking put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round to make out who\\nwas talking\\nalice could see as well as if she were looking over their shoulders\\nthat all the jurors were writing down stupid things on their slates\\nand she could even make out that one of them didnt know how to spell\\nstupid and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him a nice\\nmuddle their slatesll be in before the trials over thought alice\\none of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked this of course alice\\ncould not stand and she went round the court and got behind him and\\nvery soon found an opportunity of taking it away she did it so quickly\\nthat the poor little juror it was bill the lizard could not make out\\nat all what had become of it so after hunting all about for it he was\\nobliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day and this was\\nof very little use as it left no mark on the slate\\nherald read the accusation said the king\\non this the white rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet and then\\nunrolled the parchment scroll and read as follows\\n   the queen of hearts she made some tarts\\n      all on a summer day\\n    the knave of hearts he stole those tarts\\n      and took them quite away\\nconsider your verdict the king said to the jury\\nnot yet not yet the rabbit hastily interrupted theres a great\\ndeal to come before that\\ncall the first witness said the king and the white rabbit blew three\\nblasts on the trumpet and called out first witness\\nthe first witness was the hatter he came in with a teacup in one\\nhand and a piece of breadandbutter in the other i beg pardon your\\nmajesty he began for bringing these in but i hadnt quite finished\\nmy tea when i was sent for\\nyou ought to have finished said the king when did you begin\\nthe hatter looked at the march hare who had followed him into the\\ncourt arminarm with the dormouse fourteenth of march i think it\\nwas he said\\nfifteenth said the march hare\\nsixteenth added the dormouse\\nwrite that down the king said to the jury and the jury eagerly\\nwrote down all three dates on their slates and then added them up and\\nreduced the answer to shillings and pence\\ntake off your hat the king said to the hatter\\nit isnt mine said the hatter\\nstolen the king exclaimed turning to the jury who instantly made a\\nmemorandum of the fact\\ni keep them to sell the hatter added as an explanation ive none of\\nmy own im a hatter\\nhere the queen put on her spectacles and began staring at the hatter\\nwho turned pale and fidgeted\\ngive your evidence said the king and dont be nervous or ill have\\nyou executed on the spot\\nthis did not seem to encourage the witness at all he kept shifting\\nfrom one foot to the other looking uneasily at the queen and in\\nhis confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the\\nbreadandbutter\\njust at this moment alice felt a very curious sensation which puzzled\\nher a good deal until she made out what it was she was beginning to\\ngrow larger again and she thought at first she would get up and leave\\nthe court but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as\\nlong as there was room for her\\ni wish you wouldnt squeeze so said the dormouse who was sitting\\nnext to her i can hardly breathe\\ni cant help it said alice very meekly im growing\\nyouve no right to grow here said the dormouse\\ndont talk nonsense said alice more boldly you know youre growing\\ntoo\\nyes but i grow at a reasonable pace said the dormouse not in that\\nridiculous fashion and he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the\\nother side of the court\\nall this time the queen had never left off staring at the hatter and\\njust as the dormouse crossed the court she said to one of the officers\\nof the court bring me the list of the singers in the last concert on\\nwhich the wretched hatter trembled so that he shook both his shoes off\\ngive your evidence the king repeated angrily or ill have you\\nexecuted whether youre nervous or not\\nim a poor man your majesty the hatter began in a trembling voice\\nand i hadnt begun my teanot above a week or soand what with the\\nbreadandbutter getting so thinand the twinkling of the tea\\nthe twinkling of the what said the king\\nit began with the tea the hatter replied\\nof course twinkling begins with a t said the king sharply do you\\ntake me for a dunce go on\\nim a poor man the hatter went on and most things twinkled after\\nthatonly the march hare said\\ni didnt the march hare interrupted in a great hurry\\nyou did said the hatter\\ni deny it said the march hare\\nhe denies it said the king leave out that part\\nwell at any rate the dormouse said the hatter went on looking\\nanxiously round to see if he would deny it too but the dormouse denied\\nnothing being fast asleep\\nafter that continued the hatter i cut some more breadandbutter\\nbut what did the dormouse say one of the jury asked\\nthat i cant remember said the hatter\\nyou must remember remarked the king or ill have you executed\\nthe miserable hatter dropped his teacup and breadandbutter and went\\ndown on one knee im a poor man your majesty he began\\nyoure a very poor speaker said the king\\nhere one of the guineapigs cheered and was immediately suppressed by\\nthe officers of the court as that is rather a hard word i will just\\nexplain to you how it was done they had a large canvas bag which tied\\nup at the mouth with strings into this they slipped the guineapig\\nhead first and then sat upon it\\nim glad ive seen that done thought alice ive so often read\\nin the newspapers at the end of trials there was some attempts\\nat applause which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the\\ncourt and i never understood what it meant till now\\nif thats all you know about it you may stand down continued the\\nking\\ni cant go no lower said the hatter im on the floor as it is\\nthen you may sit down the king replied\\nhere the other guineapig cheered and was suppressed\\ncome that finished the guineapigs thought alice now we shall get\\non better\\nid rather finish my tea said the hatter with an anxious look at the\\nqueen who was reading the list of singers\\nyou may go said the king and the hatter hurriedly left the court\\nwithout even waiting to put his shoes on\\nand just take his head off outside the queen added to one of the\\nofficers but the hatter was out of sight before the officer could get\\nto the door\\ncall the next witness said the king\\nthe next witness was the duchesss cook she carried the pepperbox in\\nher hand and alice guessed who it was even before she got into the\\ncourt by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once\\ngive your evidence said the king\\nshant said the cook\\nthe king looked anxiously at the white rabbit who said in a low voice\\nyour majesty must crossexamine this witness\\nwell if i must i must the king said with a melancholy air and\\nafter folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were\\nnearly out of sight he said in a deep voice what are tarts made of\\npepper mostly said the cook\\ntreacle said a sleepy voice behind her\\ncollar that dormouse the queen shrieked out behead that dormouse\\nturn that dormouse out of court suppress him pinch him off with his\\nwhiskers\\nfor some minutes the whole court was in confusion getting the dormouse\\nturned out and by the time they had settled down again the cook had\\ndisappeared\\nnever mind said the king with an air of great relief call the next\\nwitness and he added in an undertone to the queen really my dear\\nyou must crossexamine the next witness it quite makes my forehead\\nache\\nalice watched the white rabbit as he fumbled over the list feeling very\\ncurious to see what the next witness would be like for they havent\\ngot much evidence yet she said to herself imagine her surprise when\\nthe white rabbit read out at the top of his shrill little voice the\\nname alice\\nhere cried alice quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how\\nlarge she had grown in the last few minutes and she jumped up in such\\na hurry that she tipped over the jurybox with the edge of her skirt\\nupsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below and there\\nthey lay sprawling about reminding her very much of a globe of goldfish\\nshe had accidentally upset the week before\\noh i beg your pardon she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay and\\nbegan picking them up again as quickly as she could for the accident of\\nthe goldfish kept running in her head and she had a vague sort of idea\\nthat they must be collected at once and put back into the jurybox or\\nthey would die\\nthe trial cannot proceed said the king in a very grave voice until\\nall the jurymen are back in their proper placesall he repeated with\\ngreat emphasis looking hard at alice as he said do\\nalice looked at the jurybox and saw that in her haste she had put\\nthe lizard in head downwards and the poor little thing was waving its\\ntail about in a melancholy way being quite unable to move she soon got\\nit out again and put it right not that it signifies much she said\\nto herself i should think it would be quite as much use in the trial\\none way up as the other\\nas soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being\\nupset and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to\\nthem they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the\\naccident all except the lizard who seemed too much overcome to do\\nanything but sit with its mouth open gazing up into the roof of the\\ncourt\\nwhat do you know about this business the king said to alice\\nnothing said alice\\nnothing whatever persisted the king\\nnothing whatever said alice\\nthats very important the king said turning to the jury they were\\njust beginning to write this down on their slates when the white rabbit\\ninterrupted unimportant your majesty means of course he said in a\\nvery respectful tone but frowning and making faces at him as he spoke\\nunimportant of course i meant the king hastily said and went on\\nto himself in an undertone\\nimportantunimportantunimportantimportant as if he were trying\\nwhich word sounded best\\nsome of the jury wrote it down important and some unimportant\\nalice could see this as she was near enough to look over their slates\\nbut it doesnt matter a bit she thought to herself\\nat this moment the king who had been for some time busily writing in\\nhis notebook cackled out silence and read out from his book rule\\nfortytwo all persons more than a mile high to leave the court\\neverybody looked at alice\\nim not a mile high said alice\\nyou are said the king\\nnearly two miles high added the queen\\nwell i shant go at any rate said alice besides thats not a\\nregular rule you invented it just now\\nits the oldest rule in the book said the king\\nthen it ought to be number one said alice\\nthe king turned pale and shut his notebook hastily consider your\\nverdict he said to the jury in a low trembling voice\\ntheres more evidence to come yet please your majesty said the white\\nrabbit jumping up in a great hurry this paper has just been picked\\nup\\nwhats in it said the queen\\ni havent opened it yet said the white rabbit but it seems to be a\\nletter written by the prisoner toto somebody\\nit must have been that said the king unless it was written to\\nnobody which isnt usual you know\\nwho is it directed to said one of the jurymen\\nit isnt directed at all said the white rabbit in fact theres\\nnothing written on the outside he unfolded the paper as he spoke and\\nadded it isnt a letter after all its a set of verses\\nare they in the prisoners handwriting asked another of the jurymen\\nno theyre not said the white rabbit and thats the queerest thing\\nabout it the jury all looked puzzled\\nhe must have imitated somebody elses hand said the king the jury\\nall brightened up again\\nplease your majesty said the knave i didnt write it and they\\ncant prove i did theres no name signed at the end\\nif you didnt sign it said the king that only makes the matter\\nworse you must have meant some mischief or else youd have signed your\\nname like an honest man\\nthere was a general clapping of hands at this it was the first really\\nclever thing the king had said that day\\nthat proves his guilt said the queen\\nit proves nothing of the sort said alice why you dont even know\\nwhat theyre about\\nread them said the king\\nthe white rabbit put on his spectacles where shall i begin please\\nyour majesty he asked\\nbegin at the beginning the king said gravely and go on till you\\ncome to the end then stop\\nthese were the verses the white rabbit read\\n   they told me you had been to her\\n    and mentioned me to him\\n   she gave me a good character\\n    but said i could not swim\\n   he sent them word i had not gone\\n    we know it to be true\\n   if she should push the matter on\\n    what would become of you\\n   i gave her one they gave him two\\n    you gave us three or more\\n   they all returned from him to you\\n    though they were mine before\\n   if i or she should chance to be\\n    involved in this affair\\n   he trusts to you to set them free\\n    exactly as we were\\n   my notion was that you had been\\n    before she had this fit\\n   an obstacle that came between\\n    him and ourselves and it\\n   dont let him know she liked them best\\n    for this must ever be\\n   a secret kept from all the rest\\n    between yourself and me\\nthats the most important piece of evidence weve heard yet said the\\nking rubbing his hands so now let the jury\\nif any one of them can explain it said alice she had grown so large\\nin the last few minutes that she wasnt a bit afraid of interrupting\\nhim ill give him sixpence i dont believe theres an atom of\\nmeaning in it\\nthe jury all wrote down on their slates she doesnt believe theres an\\natom of meaning in it but none of them attempted to explain the paper\\nif theres no meaning in it said the king that saves a world of\\ntrouble you know as we neednt try to find any and yet i dont know\\nhe went on spreading out the verses on his knee and looking at them\\nwith one eye i seem to see some meaning in them after all said\\ni could not swim you cant swim can you he added turning to the\\nknave\\nthe knave shook his head sadly do i look like it he said which he\\ncertainly did not being made entirely of cardboard\\nall right so far said the king and he went on muttering over\\nthe verses to himself we know it to be true thats the jury of\\ncoursei gave her one they gave him two why that must be what he\\ndid with the tarts you know\\nbut it goes on they all returned from him to you said alice\\nwhy there they are said the king triumphantly pointing to the tarts\\non the table nothing can be clearer than that then againbefore she\\nhad this fit you never had fits my dear i think he said to the\\nqueen\\nnever said the queen furiously throwing an inkstand at the lizard\\nas she spoke the unfortunate little bill had left off writing on his\\nslate with one finger as he found it made no mark but he now hastily\\nbegan again using the ink that was trickling down his face as long as\\nit lasted\\nthen the words dont fit you said the king looking round the court\\nwith a smile there was a dead silence\\nits a pun the king added in an offended tone and everybody laughed\\nlet the jury consider their verdict the king said for about the\\ntwentieth time that day\\nno no said the queen sentence firstverdict afterwards\\nstuff and nonsense said alice loudly the idea of having the\\nsentence first\\nhold your tongue said the queen turning purple\\ni wont said alice\\noff with her head the queen shouted at the top of her voice nobody\\nmoved\\nwho cares for you said alice she had grown to her full size by this\\ntime youre nothing but a pack of cards\\nat this the whole pack rose up into the air and came flying down upon\\nher she gave a little scream half of fright and half of anger and\\ntried to beat them off and found herself lying on the bank with her\\nhead in the lap of her sister who was gently brushing away some dead\\nleaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face\\nwake up alice dear said her sister why what a long sleep youve\\nhad\\noh ive had such a curious dream said alice and she told her\\nsister as well as she could remember them all these strange adventures\\nof hers that you have just been reading about and when she had\\nfinished her sister kissed her and said it was a curious dream\\ndear certainly but now run in to your tea its getting late so\\nalice got up and ran off thinking while she ran as well she might\\nwhat a wonderful dream it had been\\nbut her sister sat still just as she left her leaning her head on her\\nhand watching the setting sun and thinking of little alice and all her\\nwonderful adventures till she too began dreaming after a fashion and\\nthis was her dream\\nfirst she dreamed of little alice herself and once again the tiny\\nhands were clasped upon her knee and the bright eager eyes were looking\\nup into hersshe could hear the very tones of her voice and see that\\nqueer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that\\nwould always get into her eyesand still as she listened or seemed to\\nlisten the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures\\nof her little sisters dream\\nthe long grass rustled at her feet as the white rabbit hurried bythe\\nfrightened mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring poolshe\\ncould hear the rattle of the teacups as the march hare and his friends\\nshared their neverending meal and the shrill voice of the queen\\nordering off her unfortunate guests to executiononce more the pigbaby\\nwas sneezing on the duchesss knee while plates and dishes crashed\\naround itonce more the shriek of the gryphon the squeaking of the\\nlizards slatepencil and the choking of the suppressed guineapigs\\nfilled the air mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable mock\\nturtle\\nso she sat on with closed eyes and half believed herself in\\nwonderland though she knew she had but to open them again and all\\nwould change to dull realitythe grass would be only rustling in the\\nwind and the pool rippling to the waving of the reedsthe rattling\\nteacups would change to tinkling sheepbells and the queens shrill\\ncries to the voice of the shepherd boyand the sneeze of the baby the\\nshriek of the gryphon and all the other queer noises would change she\\nknew to the confused clamour of the busy farmyardwhile the lowing\\nof the cattle in the distance would take the place of the mock turtles\\nheavy sobs\\nlastly she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers\\nwould in the aftertime be herself a grown woman and how she would\\nkeep through all her riper years the simple and loving heart of her\\nchildhood and how she would gather about her other little children and\\nmake their eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale perhaps even\\nwith the dream of wonderland of long ago and how she would feel with\\nall their simple sorrows and find a pleasure in all their simple joys\\nremembering her own childlife and the happy summer days\\n              the end\\n'"
